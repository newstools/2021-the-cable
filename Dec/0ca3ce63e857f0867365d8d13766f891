Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has expressed delight at the return of football to the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The rehabilitated facility hosted a pre-season tournament tagged ‘Presidential Cup’ over the weekend. Speaking on Monday in Abuja, Dare said the return of football to the stadium demonstrated the commitment of the Muhammadu Buhari administration to infrastructural development in all spheres of the national life, especially sports. The minister also disclosed that the national stadium in Lagos would be the next in line for renovation. “This Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja is now an actualised dream. As an administration, this is what we are committed to and the next stop is the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos,” he said. “The President’s Cup was used to test the Abuja pitch to make sure it comes alive fully. You can see the excitement in the footballers and their teams as a whole as we have now seen the impact of a good pitch on the game.” The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) sides Kano Pillars, Sunshine Stars, Akwa United and Lobi Stars participated in the three-day tournament that ended on Sunday, and played in round robin format. Six matches were played in all, three by each team, with Pillars emerging winners with two wins and a draw while Sunshine Stars finished second with two wins and a loss. Akwa United came third with a win, a draw and a loss while Lobi Stars, with three losses, finished in bottom place.
