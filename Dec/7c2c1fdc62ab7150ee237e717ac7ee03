Folasade Yemi-Esan, the head of service of the federation, says the  recently-approved federal civil service strategy and implementation plan (FCSSIP) 2021-2025, will focus on improving effectiveness of workers. Yemi-Esan said this on Friday at the federal civil service innovation challenge awards ceremony in Abuja. She said innovation is a priority reform initiative in the FCSSIP 2021-2025 due to how critical it is to achieving the desired dream of a world-class public service. “Holistically, FCSSIP25 sets to create and sustain an enabling environment to promote competitiveness, innovation, a performance based system and meritocracy in the service,” she said. “In driving the implementation of the plan, we will leverage more on technology for a number of activities so as to make better decisions on how public servants are hired, trained and retained, to monitor performance and deliver services in an effective and efficient manner to reduce wastage and sustain trust in government. “For this reason, we are collaborating with private sector organisations and development partners, and we also encourage more stakeholder collaboration because government alone cannot achieve this.” Yemi-Esan assured workers that the federal government would reinforce structures such as the innovation department for better delivery. “I reaffirm the commitment of the office of the head of the civil service of the federation to ongoing reforms in driving culture change and change management in the service,” she said. “However, to unlock these potentials, we must first of all recognise the cardinal role innovation plays as a catalyst for positive change and development in any economy. “The benefits of innovation to the operation of Nigeria’s public service is undoubtedly very crucial for effective public service management.”
