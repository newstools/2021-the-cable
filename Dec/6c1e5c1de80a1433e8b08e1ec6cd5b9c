Salihu Lukman, director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), says negotiations among leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) should be of top priority. In a letter dated December 16, Lukman said there is a need to have the negotiations “in order to arrive at agreements, which should be respected by all”. He attached a publication — ‘APC and Campaign for New Nigeria resourceful’ — to the letter. The PGF director-general said in the publication, Buni will find recommendations to many challenges facing the country and the party. “Kindly find attached the publication, ‘APC and Campaign for New Nigeria’, which is part of the ongoing effort to support you and all APC leaders with perspectives which highlight all the manifest challenges of developing Nigeria’s democracy,” he wrote. “Issues in the publication analyse many of the challenges facing the country and make recommendations appropriately. “A major recommendation of the publication is the need to prioritise negotiations among political leaders within the party in order to arrive at agreements, which should be respected by all. The most important platforms for negotiations in APC are the structures as provided by the constitution of the party. “Also recall that APC is a party that has oriented its politics around by ensuring that its campaigns capture the aspirations of Nigerians. This was the orientation in 2015, which made Nigerians vote for the party and our candidates. “This requires a lot of backbreaking work, which took more than a year between 2013 and 2014. With all the challenges facing the country, the minimum is that the APC manifesto must be reviewed before the February 2022 Convention to guide the party’s campaign for 2023.”
