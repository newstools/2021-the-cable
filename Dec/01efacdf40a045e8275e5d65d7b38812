On Thursday, a 2-year-old Titan Trust Bank (TTB) acquired an 89.39 percent stake in the 104-year old Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. Players have described the acquisition as a laudable achievement for the newly-established bank. Titan Trust operates as a commercial bank with national authorisation. “The bank was established on the 12th of December, 2018 and started operating fully as a commercial national bank after obtaining its National Banking license on the 26th of April, 2019,” a statement profiling the bank on its website reads. In 2019, the bank recorded a profit of N644 million, and in 2020, its after-tax profit rose to N2.9 billion. The bank prides its license as being the “first national banking license that the Central Bank of Nigeria has granted in the last ten years”. “The Bank was formed to take advantage of the identified gaps in the banking sector and address the unmet needs of the retail mass market, SMEs and corporate institutions,” the profile reads further. So, who are the titans behind the new bank?
