The police command in Kogi, on Saturday, announced a ban on the use of fireworks during the Christmas and New Year celebrations in the state. The decision was contained in a statement issued by Williams Ovye-Aya, spokesman of the Kogi police command. According to the statement, Idrisu Dauda-Dabban, Kogi commissioner of police, warned residents against violating the order. He also advised parents and guardians to caution their children and wards, particularly the youths. “The police is determined to deal decisively with anybody that wants to cause disturbance of public peace,” he said. “In fact, anybody caught flouting this order will be arrested and prosecuted accordingly. “This is because the command will not hesitate to apply the full wrath of the law against persons who would deliberately want to take the law into their hands. “Accordingly, we advise all law abiding people in the state to go about their legitimate businesses without cause to fear as the police is on top of the situation throughout the festive period.” The police commissioner also encouraged residents to report suspicious activities in their neighbourhoods to the nearest security agents “for prompt action”.
