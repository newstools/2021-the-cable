The over two thousand students of Junior Secondary School, Idu-Koro, Abuja, would not need to dash to the bush to answer the call of nature anymore. The same goes for teachers and other non-academic staff, who before now pay N50 to have access to a public toilet a few metres from the school. Thanks to the community outreach initiative of Vento Furniture, which saw the construction of two sets of toilets for the boys and girls sections and a 3000 liters capacity borehole to ensure adequate water supply within the school premises. It was indeed an event that brought smiles to the faces of the students of Junior Secondary School, Idu-Koro, a rural settlement in Abuja Municipal Area Council, in the federal capital territory. The story of JSS Idu-Koro was indeed a touching one before the intervention of Vento Furniture. According to the chief executive officer of Vento Furniture, Hassan Yigit, during one of his numerous trips around rural communities in search of areas of CSR interventions, he came across a near pitiable situation at the JSS Idu-Koro. He said: “I was in the company of one of my colleagues, Sadiq Mahmood, when we stumbled on the situation at the school. Upon inquiry, we realised that the school that accommodates close to 2000 students has just one lavatory that wasn’t in a good state and meant to cater for both male and female students.” “I wasn’t comfortable with such because as a father to young children, I know the importance of personal hygiene, especially for the female students of the school. I immediately moved for the construction of a lavatory each for the boys and girls section, and we also agreed to construct a borehole with 3000 litres capacity storage to supply water to the school.” Consequently, the company collaborated with the Abuja Enterprise agency to get all the required clearance to commence the project. At the commissioning of the project, which attracted several government officials from the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), the FCT Universal Basic Board (UBEB), and the Abuja Enterprise agency, it was all praise for the efforts of Vento Furniture in the execution of the project. For Fatima Iliya (not real name), a JSS three student in the school, the new toilet facility would ease the burden of most students when it is time to answer the call of nature. Iliya said: “We used to go to the bush to answer the call of nature because the only toilet in the school is bad, and there is no water to flush. Sometimes, we leave school for home whenever we want to use the toilet. But today, you can see all of us are very happy. We pray for God to bless Vento Furniture.” James Madaki, also a student of JSS Idu-Koro, was not left out in the excitement. He stated that Christmas came early for them. “Today is like Christmas for us. We can’t believe that we can have a good toilet that uses water in our school. Our school toilet is the best in Idu-Koro. I want to thank Vento Furniture and also plead that they build toilets for other JSS schools in Abuja,” Madaki said. Abdulrazaq Laramo, acting secretary for education in the FCTA, who represented the permanent secretary, FCT, stated that the gesture by Vento Furniture would indeed have a positive impact on the lives and well-being of students, management and teachers of JSS Idu-Koro. “The FCT administration led by the honourable minister of FCT, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, and the honourable minister of state, Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, heartily appreciate and commend this awesome gesture demonstrated by Vento International Trading Company as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) to boost the health and sanitary standard of our children in this learning institution,” he said. He further added that the CSR initiative is in alignment with the commitment and policy direction of the FCT administration in ensuring that all public schools within the territory and all residents of FCT have access to safe and potable water, as well as functional toilet facilities, to enhance personal hygiene, improved environmental sanitation and overall health status. Also present at the occasion was the brand ambassador of Vento Furniture and veteran journalist Olusegun Adeniyi. He stated that ever since he became a brand ambassador of Vento Furniture earlier in the year, he had seen genuine efforts to give back to society in meaningful ways. And there can be nothing more significant than putting smiles on the faces of those who represent the future of our country, like the students of the Junior Secondary School Idu-Koro. “People engage in CSR for various reasons. The construction of modern toilet facilities and a borehole by Vento Furniture is borne out of genuine concern for the general well-being of the staff and students of this school. And I am delighted to witness this important milestone. For Vento Furniture, this is just the beginning of an exciting policy of enhancing the quality of life, especially for the less privileged of our society. In the weeks, months, and years to come, by its projection, Vento Furniture intends to intervene in other areas of public life like hospitals and orphanages,” he said. “I understand, from the interactions I have had with the management of Vento Furniture in recent weeks, that the company has an overarching objective to provide social amenities in public schools and other areas of concern for rural dwellers within the Federal Capital Territory and environs. The amenities being commissioned today are significant. So, Vento Furniture is showing the way for other public-spirited individuals and corporate bodies in the efforts to rebuild social sectors like education and health.” Adeniyi further appealed to the FCT authorities to continue to leave their doors open to Vento Furniture in its quest to be worthy partners not only for the progress of Abuja and environ but also that of the country. In a show of appreciation, the Madaki of Idu-Koro, Mallam Muhammed Danteni, on behalf of the Idu-Koro community, presented a ram to the chief executive officer of Vento Furniture, Hassan Yigit. “We thank Vento Furniture for bringing joy to our community. We thank Mr Hassan for what he has done for this community. On behalf of the people of this community, please accept this gift of a ram from us,” he stated. Aside from the commissioning of the project, the elated students of the school also entertained the audience with cultural displays to show appreciation to Vento Furniture for their kind gesture. The school principal was also full of praises for the management of Vento Furniture and promised to see to the maintenance of the facilities. It was gathered that Vento Furniture has other ongoing CSR projects that are nearing completion in other critical areas such as public hospitals and orphanage homes. <img class="alignnone
