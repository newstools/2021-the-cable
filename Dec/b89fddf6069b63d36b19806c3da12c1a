An estate in Borno state was rocked by an explosion in the early hours of Saturday. Boko Haram insurgents were said to have launched mortars at the estate. The attack affected several buildings in the 1000 Housing Estate located in Maiduguri, Borno state capital. A victim told TheCable that members of his family sustained injuries as a result of the attack. Explosives were also fired at Ngomari Airport, another community in the state capital. A mortar also landed at 2589, Elkenemi street, a house owned by one Kullima, popularly known as coach. Kullima told TheCable that he was in his room when the explosive landed in his wife’s room. He said members of his family sustained injuries as a result of the attack and are receiving treatment at a hospital. The attack caused panic in the affected communities as several residents in Maiduguri scampered for safety. In February, many people were feared dead after the insurgents launched a similar attack while attempting to infiltrate Maiduguri.
