Nuhu Bature, the Agwam Kajju, ruler of the Zonkwa chiefdom in Zango Kataf LGA of Kaduna, is dead. Bature was said to have died on Saturday after a brief illness at a hospital in Kafanchan, headquarters of Jama’a LGA. The late traditional ruler is described as an entrepreneur who founded a popular bookshop located at Rwang Pam street in Jos, the Plateau capital. He is said to be the first to ascend the throne as Agwam Bajju after the title was created in 1995. According to a statement by Muyiwa Adekeye, media aide to the governor, Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, mourned the late chief, describing him as a “decent monarch and a proponent of peaceful existence, whose counsel and wisdom was always cherished”. “The Kaduna State Government acknowledges and salutes his stature as a royal father who sought to build bridges as part of his resolute commitment to peace and harmony,” the statement reads. “Malam El-Rufai has sent a message of condolence to the family of the revered monarch, praying God to grant him peaceful repose, comfort his family and the entire Zonkwa chiefdom.”
