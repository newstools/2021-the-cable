The Imo police command says it has rescued Damian Nwaigwe, the traditional ruler of Mbutu in Aboh-Mbaise council area, who was abducted by gunmen. Nwaigwe was kidnapped at his palace on Thursday morning — a day after Edwin Azike, the traditional ruler of Atta autonomous community in Njaba council area, was abducted. Michael Abattam, police spokesman in Imo, said the traditional ruler had been reunited with his family. He added that security had also been beefed up in the area. TheCable had reported that Azike was found dead at a market square in his area on Friday. He was reportedly murdered while his corpse was dumped at the market square. “The traditional ruler of Atta ancient kingdom in the Njaba LGA, Eze Edwin Azike, has been murdered. His lifeless body was dumped at the market square, and the villagers discovered it this morning. He was kidnapped on Thursday, and thereafter, the community was invaded which led to the killing of four persons,” a resident had told TheCable. The police had also said it has commenced an investigation into the incident. In October, three traditional rulers were killed after gunmen invaded the Nnenasa community, Njaba LGA of the state. The monarchs were said to be holding a meeting in the area when the gunmen attacked them.
