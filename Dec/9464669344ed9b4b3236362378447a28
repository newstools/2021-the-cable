Some members of the Lagos4Lagos movement, a group affiliated with the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Saturday, voted in favour of defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Delegates of the PDP led by Raymond Dokpesi, former chairman of Daar Communications, had visited the group on November 8. The meeting with the PDP delegates was part of efforts to advocate a collaboration with Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran, visioner of the movement, on joining the opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election. The visit came weeks after the Lagos4Lagos movement organised a parallel state congress for the Lagos APC, and also condemned the leadership of the party in the state for adopting consensus as the option for electing ward executives. In a video posted on his Facebook page, Bukola Saraki, former senate president, is seen calling for a voice vote on the group’s defection from APC to PDP. “Those in favour that Lagos4Lagos should move to PDP say ‘aye’,” Saraki said, calling for a vote in the manner done at plenary at the senate. Members of the group chorused “aye” in response and Saraki said, “the ayes have it”. He, however, did not ask if any members were against defecting to PDP. “We just took a vote: “All those in favour of the #Lagos4Lagos movement moving to the PDP, say: ‘Aye!’ The ‘ayes’ have it! #welcome,” Saraki captioned the video.
