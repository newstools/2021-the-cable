Former President Goodluck Jonathan has called for renewed measures to address the “dead” local government system in the country. Speaking on Thursday when he delivered a graduation lecture at the National Institute for Security Studies in Abuja, Jonathan said states must take deliberate steps to revive the local government system. He also said addressing the issues affecting governance at the grassroots will help in the fight against insecurity. “Most of these security conflicts are happening because of the weakness of the lower tiers of government. The local government system that is supposed to interphase with communities directly and prevent this is dead in this country,” he said. “Since the local governments are mainly managed by the states now — because we are told that some states even take their money — I think the states must have strong departments that will coordinate the affairs of local governments. “And these departments must have regular meetings with traditional rulers and community development committees.” Jonathan’s comments come amid calls for governors to grant financial autonomy for state houses of assembly and local governments. In May 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari had, through an executive order, granted financial autonomy to legislature and judiciary arms of all states. “Based on the power vested in me under Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution (as Amended), I, today, signed into law Executive Order No. 10 of 2020 for the implementation of Financial Autonomy of State Legislature and State Judiciary,” he had said. The governors had, in April 2021, approved a template for financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary. However, some states are yet to grant full autonomy to their legislature and judiciary, as well as local governments.
