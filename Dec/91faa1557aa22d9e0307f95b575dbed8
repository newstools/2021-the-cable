The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says it will enforce the use of speed limiting devices for commercial vehicles to prevent road crashes during the festive period. Boboye Oyeyemi, FRSC corps marshal, disclosed this on Thursday while monitoring the traffic on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway as well as other highways in Lagos. According to NAN, Oyeyemi said he will be on the ground for patrol operations during the festive season. “We are battle ready to enforce speed limit devices on commercial vehicles to further cut down the rate of crashes on the road,” he said. “Our officials are focusing more on the commercial vehicles because of several passengers in the vehicles — some 12, some 18 passengers or more — and in some cases, the crashes involving these vehicles are fatal because of the number of people involved. “But the present figures show that we have achieved significant reductions in road crashes in the last 12 months. “The quality of work done on the road now is exceptional, and that is why we are focusing more on enforcing speed limiting devices to curtail excess speed by the motorists. “Our men are still going to focus on overloading, drunk driving, and driving without valid driver’s licence will also be prosecuted and the vehicles impounded.” The corps marshal said about 1,300 patrol vehicles have been dispatched across the country to ensure free movement. “I was in Iwo road in Ibadan yesterday; the road was free. Likewise Enugu, Ilorin, Asaba up to the northern part of the country, there was free vehicular movement in all these corridors,” Oyeyemi said. “We have been working with the states to ensure the roads are free, especially Lagos-Ibadan expressway with high vehicular density. “We want to assure the road users that nobody will sleep on the road as a result of gridlock during this festive period.” He also warned drivers against overloading, night journeys and using rickety vehicles.
