The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) says its members have resolved to write a book on solutions to governance challenges in the country. In a communique issued on Wednesday at the end of a teleconference meeting, the forum said each governor will write a chapter on their personal experiences in governance. The NGF stated that the book will help incoming governors solve the difficulties they encounter while governing their states. “Members of the Forum resolved to each write a chapter (in their own words) in a flagship compendium that is being put together by the NGF Secretariat in collaboration with Dr. Joe Abah,” the governors said. “The book seeks to draw on the personal experiences of governors in the spirit of the States Peer Review Mechanism. It will feature practical ideas, solutions and approaches to solving difficult governance challenges in Nigeria for the  benefit of incoming governors, academics and members of the public. “Members received a presentation from Dr. Nicky Okoye, Founder, Nicky Okoye Foundation and representatives of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, on the African Enterprise Initiative: a roadmap to reposition Nigerian businesses for the global marketplace through a suite of strategies such as the accreditation and  verification of SMEs across the country to form a database for incentives, and the establishment of community enterprise clinics, funding strategies and bootcamps. “Following discussions, the Forum mandated the NGF Secretariat to review and prepare an engagement strategy between interested States and the Foundation.” The forum said members also received a detailed presentation on the proposed privatisation of ten (10) generating plants located across the country under the National Integrated Power Projects (NIPPs).
