The Plateau government has lifted the curfew imposed on Jos north, Jos south and Bassa LGAs of the state. The development comes months after separate attacks on communities in the three LGAs. A curfew had been imposed on the LGAs in August, but it was later relaxed in September. According to a statement issued on Friday by Makut Macham, spokesman to the Plateau government, there will be improved security patrol in the areas. “The Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has directed the total lifting of the existing curfew in Jos North, Jos South, and Bassa Local Government Areas earlier imposed on September 8th 2021, from 10pm to 6am, as part of efforts to curb the insecurity witnessed some months ago,” the statement reads. “The Governor gave the directive after a State Security Council Meeting held at the Government House, Rayfield, Jos, where the Council reviewed the security situation in the affected Local Government Areas and the State in general. “On the strength of deliberations at the meeting and the advice of the Security Council, the Governor directed that the existing curfew be lifted with effect from Friday 17th December 2021 until further notice. “He directed that in place of the curfew, the relevant security agencies should mount well coordinated and round-the-clock checks in strategic areas of the State to ensure the safety of lives and properties of the people during the yuletide season. “He advised the security agencies to ensure that they deploy security personnel throughout the State and gather requisite intelligence to thwart any attempt by criminals who might want to perpetrate their nefarious activities during the season and cause a breach of the peace.” The state added that the ban on motorcycles in the Jos-Bukuru area is still in force, and commended residents for their understanding, as well as security agencies for their efforts at maintaining peace.
