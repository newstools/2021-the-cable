The Lagos state government says it accepts the recommendation of the judicial panel of inquiry to declare October 20 as a toll-free day “as long as the Lekki tollgate exists”. A white-paper committee was set up by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, following the submission of the judicial panel’s report. The panel had, on November 15, submitted two reports to the governor — one on police brutality cases in the state and another on the Lekki incident. According to the white paper released on Tuesday, the state government also accepted the recommendation of the panel to establish a ‘Peace Park’ as a reminder of peaceful protest in the state. “Lagos State Government will designate a park in the state and name it ‘Peace Park’ to serve as a reminder to the citizens of Lagos State of the peaceful protest all over the state against abuse of human rights,” the document reads. The white-paper committee also said “in the spirit of healing and reconciliation”, the state government will accept the panel’s recommendation that “October 20th of every year, the day is made a ‘Toll Free Day’ at the Lekki Toll Gate as long as the tollgate exists”.
