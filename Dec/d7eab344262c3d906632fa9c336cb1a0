Digital transformation leader, Globacom, on Thursday continued its Joy Unlimited prize presentation across the country with two more Nigerians driving home brand new cars in Uyo and Kaduna. Ubong Charles Ukpong, an administrative officer at University of Uyo, was the Kia Rio car winner in Uyo. The 42-year-old Akwa Ibom indigene said, “I joined the promo about three weeks before the call and it was a great surprise. I could not believe it. Even after completing the validation and verification exercise, I was still sceptical until I received the keys today. I will forever be grateful to Glo, a company that has been taking care of Nigerians from onset”. In Kaduna, it was a 22-year-old auto mechanic, Iorav Tengu, who received the brand new Kia Rio car at Gloworld on Ahmadu Bello Way. “I cannot explain what I felt as I received the call about my prize. What Glo has done for me will change my life and also my parents. That’s why my friends have come with me today. I’m soo thankful for the promo that made this happen”.  Said a very happy Tengu Over 100 Nigerians in Uyo and Kaduna also went home with different home appliances including generators, refrigerator and televisions sets. Those who spoke at the events include representative of National Lottery Regulatory Commission in Uyo, Mr. Walson Dambo, who commended Globacom for the transparent draws that have produced many winners across the country.
