The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has warned men to stop using aphrodisiac to boost sexual performance. Moji Adeyeye, director-general of the agency, said most of the performance-enhancing drugs in circulation are not registered with NAFDAC and some were smuggled into the country. “If they were registered, the producers and peddlers would not get it to the supermarkets, social media platforms and on the streets,” NAN quoted Adeyeye as saying. “Many men have died using such drugs and their relatives would blame their death on some imaginary witches in the village. Some of the producers of these drugs will claim they have no side effect. “Majority of these products did not go through the approval process of the agency, the agency will not relent in running after the peddlers of such dangerous drugs until they are brought to book for violating the regulations.” Adeyeye said when aphrodisiacs are used without dosage and professional prescription, it could lead to internal organ damage. “When we begin to disrupt the functions of the body organs, over time it affects the imbalance and the ecosystem of how the body physiology works and can lead to unintended consequences,” she said. “For those who have certain health risks, like people that are hypertensive or people that have heart disease, there is more of anxiety that the drug could stimulate into the system and can lead to changes in the physiology of the body, stroke or sudden stoppage of the heart. “These happen in cases when men suddenly slump during sexual intercourse as reported in Rivers and Cross River states recently. “There are a lot of side effects. Every drug is a potential poison. Every drug has one side effect or the other. “These are chemical products with side effects. In some cases, there are associated adverse drug reactions which could lead to death.”
