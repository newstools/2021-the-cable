The US consulate general, on Wednesday, concluded a three-day training for security agencies on tackling gender-based violence cases. A total of 100 officers drawn from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) participated in the training. According to a statement issued by the US consulate on Wednesday, the workshop was organised in collaboration with the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) based in the US and the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) in Nigeria. The training covered various topics such as response mechanisms for addressing gender-based violence cases as well as ensuring proper investigation. Addressing the officers at the closing ceremony which held in Lagos, Claire Pierangelo, US consul general, said the programme was part of efforts to address sexual and gender-based violence in Nigeria. “We count on you all as you lead the improvement in the management of gender-based cases at your stations,” she said. “Gender-based violence has life-threatening consequences for women and girls and will have a profound impact on their opportunities and life trajectory. No woman or girl child should live in fear of violence. Every girl should grow up knowing she is safe and free to follow her dreams and live her best life.” The training comes amid the global ’16 days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence’, which began on November 25 — the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women — and will end on December 10  –Human Rights Day.
