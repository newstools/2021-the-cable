Nasir el-Rufai, Kaduna state governor, says he does not believe in rehabilitating terrorists. He said the best way to deal with the persons terrorising Nigerians is to kill them. The governor made his position known on Tuesday while briefing state house correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. He was in the state house to brief the president on the recent attack which led to the death of 40 persons in Kaduna state. The governor was accompanied by Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs. He said: “There is nothing like repentant terrorists. The only repentant bandit is the one that is dead. Our intention in the state is to kill them (terrorists), let them go and see God.” El-Rufai said the whereabouts of the bandits are not hidden but that the military is wary of the collateral damage it could cause the civilian community. The governor said there are three types of terrorists; the Boko Haram insurgents, the bandits, and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). He said the recent declaration of bandits as terrorists has given the military more power to wage war against them. El-Rufai asked for the intervention of the president for more deployment of security forces to enable a comprehensive operation. He called on the security agencies to carry out aggressive operations against the terrorists.
