The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says Nigeria has recorded 45 cases of the Omicron COVID variant. Ifedayo Adetifa, director-general of the NCDC, disclosed this during a virtual media briefing on Friday. The NCDC DG said 13,758 sequences have been uploaded on GISAID, a global epidemic database, as at December 20. On December 1, the NCDC recorded three cases of the new variant in Nigeria. Days later, three additional cases were recorded. The index case of Omicron was detected in South Africa and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had subsequently designated Omicron as a “variant of concern”, calling on global leaders to take action to contain its spread. The NCDC DG also said no COVID death in Nigeria has been linked to the Omicron variant. Editor’s note: This story has been updated following a clarification by the NCDC that 45 cases — not 49 — have so far been detected in the country.
