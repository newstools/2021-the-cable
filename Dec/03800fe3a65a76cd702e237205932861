The private sector-led coalition against COVID-19 (CACOVID) says Nigerians must be united in tackling the Omicron COVID variant. In a statement signed by Osita Nwasinobi, spokesperson of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the coalition asked Nigerians to take steps to remain safe. The group said it has intensified its efforts in the fight against the coronavirus, asking Nigerians to get vaccinated. “Nigeria has faced deadly viruses in the past and has surmounted them. In all of those incidents, one thing that was common was our unified front. The same is needed now if we are to combat the deadly new variant of the coronavirus – Omicron,” the statement reads. “We must maintain social distancing in public gatherings, wear our face masks, avoid poorly ventilated areas, wash and sanitize our hands regularly. Most importantly we must get vaccinated. “CACOVID is urging all Nigerians to get vaccinated and put an end to the spread of the coronavirus in Nigeria. Let’s work together to make Nigeria virus-free. The index case of Omicron was detected in South Africa in November, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had subsequently designated Omicron as a “variant of concern”, calling on global leaders to take action to contain its spread. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced on December 1 that three confirmed cases had been detected in Nigeria. The variant has already been detected in many countries including the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong. CACOVID said it has become expedient that “we all adhere to the precautionary measures highlighted by the WHO whilst getting vaccinated”. “Contrary to many false reports the vaccines are effective and can reduce the risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.”
