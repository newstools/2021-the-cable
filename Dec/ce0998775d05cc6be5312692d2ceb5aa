A federal high court in Abuja has nullified the participation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Andy Uba, in the November 6 Anambra governorship election. George Moghalu, an aspirant in the APC primary election, had approached the court challenging the process and the outcome of the primary election. He sought N122.5 million in damages, including a return of the cost paid for expressions of interest and nomination forms, as well as N100 million ” for the breach of contract to commence and conclude primary election”. The APC, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and Uba were the defendants in the suit. In a judgment delivered on Monday, Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, held that the primary election that produced Uba was not validly conducted as it was in breach of the electoral act and the party’s constitution. He described the conduct of the primary by APC as “crude and primitive”. “The real issue was not whether accredited members of 1st defendant voted on that day but whether the election was conducted in accordance with the election guidelines of 1st defendant,” the judge said. “Therefore, the case of the plaintiff succeeds on its merit.” Ekwo ordered INEC to delete Uba from its record as a candidate in the election. He also ordered the party to refund the N22.5 million paid by Moghalu for expression of interest and nomination forms. “The 2nd defendant (INEC) is compelled to delist the name of the 1st defendant and 3rd defendant from the November 6, Anambra governorship election,” he ordered.
