Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, says Nigeria will be better if those in government face the consequences of their actions. Ikeazor spoke on Saturday at the public presentation of ‘The Arc of the Possible,’ a memoir of Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), in Abuja. The minister said Adio’s book captures what is expected of people in public service. Ikeazor said the objective of going into public service should be to influence policies for the betterment of the citizens. “Looking at his book, I have glanced through it. One thing striking on what he said about us not leaving governance to the politicians is that we from the private sector with professional backgrounds should come into governance and make a difference. That is what we are all trying to do,” she said. “My goodwill message is to call on everyone here and those listening to us to please come into politics because through politics you will get into governance. If I didn’t participate in politics, I wouldn’t be where I am today. “Everyone please be part of governance for us to develop Nigeria. “What is lacking in our civil service is lack of consequence for action. Once we can instill consequence for action in governance, Nigeria will be great. Also speaking, Bolaji Abdullahi, former minister of sports and youth development, says no one would have done a better job in NEITI than Adio.
