Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles striker, says he is fit and would be available for the 2022 AFCON in Cameroon next month if selected. The 22-year-old forward alerted the coaching crew of the Super Eagles about his fitness status in a tweet on his Twitter account on Tuesday. The Napoli striker was expected to be out of action for three months after he suffered multiple facial fractures from a nasty clash of heads with Inter Milan’s Skriniar in their Serie A encounter on November 21. Osimhen was forced off in the 52nd minute with a side of his face swollen from the impact. He, however, made a remarkable return when he came back to training just three weeks after the injury. In the tweet, the Lagos-born striker said he is ready to represent Nigeria at the 2022 AFCON — billed for January 9 till February 6. “I will be available for AFCON unless I’m not among the players picked to represent Nigeria,” Osimhen wrote. He has been training individually in Naples with a face shield to protect the affected part of his face. The Eagles have been drawn in group D alongside Egypt, Guinea-Bissau and Sudan. The team will open their campaign against the Pharaohs on January 11 before taking on Sudan four days later. Their final fixture will be against Guinea-Bissau on January 19.
