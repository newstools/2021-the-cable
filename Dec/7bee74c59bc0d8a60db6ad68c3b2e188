The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos says the defection of the Lagos4Lagos movement to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cannot change the main opposition’s misfortune in the state. The splinter group defected on Saturday during an event attended by Bukola Saraki, former senate president. Reacting to the defection in an interview with NAN, Seye Oladejo, APC spokesman in Lagos, said PDP would still lose in Lagos despite the move. “There is nothing that is going to happen that will change the fortune of the PDP. They have always lost, it is in their DNA. So, they will lose again,” he said. “So, they are moving to nothing, we will meet at the polls. I can assure you they would not even win a single ward in the state.” Oladejo said the aggrieved members’ movement to the PDP underscores their political naivety “for them to think they can bring any special fortune that is unknown and alien to our state”. He added that the Lagos4Lagos movement has just formalised its membership of the opposition party and that the ruling party would not miss the group. “They have always been in the opposition anyway. We have always believed that they were acting a script. There is a limit to hypocrisy which is not sustainable,” he said. “No one plays opposition within the ruling party and hope to sustain that. So, it is a good thing that they have finally moved on. “We are happy that in some of their interviews, they promised to resurrect a dead party. I believe resurrection is left for Almighty God. “It is good they are mixing and fraternising with the dead now, which is a good thing for them. For us, we are not going to miss them. “Hopefully, someday, they will see the light and know that Lagos has always been a progressive state and remains one. They can return. “So, if they want to come back in the future, why not? Our doors remain permanently open to those who are ready to repent and see the light.”
