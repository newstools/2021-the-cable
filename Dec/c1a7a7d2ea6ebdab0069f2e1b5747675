The police command in Akwa Ibom says it has arrested two suspects for impersonation in the state. Odiko Macdon, spokesman of the Akwa Ibom police command, disclosed this in a statement issued on Friday. He said the one of the suspects was a man who claimed to be a soldier, and who was arrested during a stop-and-search operation. “On 16/11/2021, at about 1:00am, while on a stop-and-search operation along Nwaniba Road, operatives of Anti-Robbery Squad reasonably suspected and arrested one Akpan Mfon Essien ‘m’ of Ikot Andem Itam Village in Itu L.G.A, who resides at Idu Uruan, Uruan L.G.A.,” statement reads. “During interrogation, the suspect confessed to be impersonating a soldier. He led operatives to his house where two pairs of army uniforms, army shorts, two army sweaters, army belt, two army caps, three pairs of army boot, two army jack-knives, two walkie talkie, one live jacket, one stethoscope and a blue colour Toyota Camry car with Reg.

Macdon also said another suspect was arrested for impersonating a doctor. “During interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime and stated that he is not a medical doctor, as claimed,” the police spokesman said. “In his confessional statement, he stated that in 2015, he told his mother that he had gotten admission into the University of Lagos to study Medicine and that since then, he had collected various sums of money from her.” He said the “fake doctor”, who claimed to be a medical practitioner attached to University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH), was arrested on November 30 at Tranquility Hotel, Nung Oku village in Ibesikpo Asutan LGA of the state. He added that the two suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded.
