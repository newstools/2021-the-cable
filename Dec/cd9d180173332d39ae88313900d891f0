Liverpool came from a goal down to defeat Newcastle United 3-1 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield on Thursday night. The Reds recovered from an early threat from Newcastle to claim victory, thanks to goals from Diogo Jota, Mohamed Salah, and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Newcastle had taken the lead on seven minutes through Jonjo Shelvey’s 25-yard strike before Jota equalized and Salah ensured Jurgen Klopp’s side went into the interval with the lead. Alexander-Arnold arrowed into the top corner three minutes before the end of the encounter to ensure victory. Liverpool are one point behind Manchester City, the EPL leaders who have secured 40 points from 17 matches. Newcastle United are, however, mired in relegation troubles, as they wallow in the 19th position on the EPL log with 10 points. In the other match of the night, Chelsea dropped points in a 1-1 draw with Everton at Stamford Bridge, losing further ground in the title chase. The London club has won only once in four matches in all competitions. The Blues wasted gilt-edged chances in the first half and had to wait until the 70th minute to take the lead through Mason Mount. The lead lasted only four minutes, with 19-year-old Jarrad Branthwaite stabbing home on his first game of the season. Chelsea have 37 points from 17 matches and remain third on the EPL table.
