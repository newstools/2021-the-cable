Abdullahi Adamu, senator representing Nasarawa west, says the national assembly should not make laws that promote personal interests. Adamu said this following the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari not to give his assent to the electoral act amendment bill. Buhari’s decision was contained in a letter read at the senate and house of representatives. The president had said compulsory direct primary for political parties “violates the spirit of democracy”. The provisions for compulsory direct primaries and electronic transmission of election results are among the amendments proposed by the national assembly. Speaking with NAN on Tuesday, the senator said it is unfair to restrict political parties to a particular mode of nominating candidates for elections. “It is strange and unfair to come up with a law regulating how parties conduct their elections. I support the president for not signing the bill and I minced no words on the floor of the senate,” the former Nasarawa governor said. “We should appreciate that Buhari’s refusal to assent to the bill means so much. He is a very articulate person; a very deep person in thought and planning. “Some people felt a bit down with the fact that it is difficult to get two-third of members to return to the chambers. “It is a cause for concern. I am very concerned about it but the remedy is not for us to make laws to promote our personal interest. “The parties have their guidelines and conditions by which people accept to be members.”
