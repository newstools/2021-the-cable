Makinde Araoye, special adviser on federal matters to Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, has withdrawn from the state’s governorship race. Araoye’s decision to withdraw came after Wole Olanipekun, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), urged governorship aspirants in the southern part of the state to embrace unity. Olanipekun had said disunity has not allowed any candidate from that area win the governorship. In a statement on Monday, Araoye said his ambition has never been about personal gain. “Further to consultations with major stakeholders in Ekiti State, I am announcing my withdrawal from the gubernatorial race of our dear state,” he said. “This sacrifice, though against what we planned, is very sacrosanct at this juncture, in the overall interest of peace, cohesion, and unity in our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Ekiti state. I have clearly heard, and ceded to the voices of the leadership of our party in Ekiti state. “As you know, my ambition has never been about my personal gain, but to try to lead efforts to bring about ‘freedom for all, and life more abundant’ for the good people of Ekiti State as propounded by our late sage, Obafemi Awolowo, and as demonstrated by our leaders, their Excellencies: Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Dr. Kayode Fayemi. “My ambition was borne out of my conviction in the doctrine of fairness and equity and in line with the globally recognised transition trend of injecting new ideas and generational shift in governance. “In reaching this landmark decision, I am guided by history and my values as an Omoluabi. When the story of my journey in politics and governance is told, it would be one of courage and conviction, but also one of humility, unalloyed loyalty, submission, and love for the collective good.” The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed June 18, 2022 for the Ekiti governorship election.
