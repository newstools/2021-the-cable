The Lagos directorate of vehicle inspection (DVIS) says from January 2022, road worthiness certificates won’t be issued to vehicles not presented for physical inspection. The directive was contained in a video released by the DVIS on Wednesday. The development follows an earlier announcement by Frederic Oladeinde, Lagos commissioner for transportation, in November. According to the DVIS, the directive will take effect from January 1, 2022. “Starting from 1st of January, 2022, the issuance of road worthiness certificate will no longer be the same,” the agency said. “Only vehicles inspected at the Lagos computerised vehicle inspection test centres will be issued road worthiness certificates. “Road worthiness certificates will no longer be issued by proxy or through third parties. “All vehicles must comply with the minimum safety standards to get the certificates.” In November, Oladeinde, while speaking at a meeting with transport operators in Lagos, had said the new policy is part of efforts to make Lagos roads safer. “No one would be able to obtain road worthiness certificate anywhere in the state without the Vehicle Inspection Service (LACVIS) certifying such vehicles road worthy,” the commissioner had said.
