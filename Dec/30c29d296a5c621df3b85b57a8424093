Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, says bandits are enemies of humanity and should be treated as such. Tambuwal said this on Tuesday when he received a delegation of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) led by Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti. The NGF delegation was in Sokoto to commiserate with the state over security challenges — including the recent attack on a bus which led to killing of 23 travellers. According to the Sokoto governor, there is a need for Nigerians to support governments at all levels to address banditry. “In view of the persistent happenings, all hands must be on deck to check the incidents and support President Buhari at all levels on containing the situation,” NAN quoted him as saying. ”The bandits’ intentions and motives are still unravelling. When they attack a community, they kill at random, shoot everybody, irrespective of political differences. ”They do not consider ethnicity, religious or political party differences. They do not have any ideological or tribal pursuit. They are just enemies of humanity. “They are supposed to be treated as such decisively. We must all rise to save the situation.” He also expressed his appreciation to the NGF for the visit. On his part, Fayemi expressed condolences to Sokoto state on the recent attacks by bandits, adding that the government will continue to work on measures to address the situation. ”We stand with governor Tambuwal and other citizens over the sad incident. We shall continue to focus on the ways to curtail the situation and pray to Almighty Allah to stop the menace,” he said. ”We are aware of Tambuwal’s parley with President Muhammadu Buhari along with federal government delegation that visited Sokoto on condolence visit and obtained direct situation reports on the incidents.” Also present during the visit were Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa and Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi.
