The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), says as of December 29, over 10 million people have received the first jab of the COVID vaccine. The agency disclosed this on Thursday in an update posted on its Facebook page. “10,153,074 of total eligible persons targeted for COVID-19 vaccination reached with first dose while 4,443,297 of total eligible persons targeted for COVID-19 vaccination reached with second dose (fully vaccinated),” the update reads. Lagos is currently in the lead, accounting for 1,310,344 of the doses administered, followed by Ogun with 673,783, and Jigawa with 630,935. According to data provided by the NPHCDA, the proportion of people who have received one dose of the vaccine in Nigeria represents nine percent of the eligible population, while those who are fully vaccinated represents four percent. The data also showed that the federal government has so far administered 35,274 booster doses of the vaccine in 27 states since its rollout began on December 10. On March 2, Nigeria received 3.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine courtesy of COVAX, and began vaccinating citizens on March 5. Since the first batch was received, the country has also received the Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer vaccines. In its bid to get more people vaccinated, the federal government introduced mass COVID vaccination of eligible Nigerians in offices, churches, and universities. The federal government also mandated civil servants to show proof of COVID test or vaccination beginning from December 1 before they can be allowed into offices.
