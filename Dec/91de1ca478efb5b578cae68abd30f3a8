Dennis Idahosa, lawmaker representing Ovia federal constituency, has asked residents of Edo to stone politicians who renege on their campaign promises. Idahosa spoke when he distributed motorcycles to 160 women and youths at Iguobazuwa, Ovia south-west LGA of Edo, on Saturday. He said with the standard that has been set in the constituency, people will no longer tolerate a non-performer. Idahosa, who is the chairman of the house of representatives committee on legislative compliance, said aside from the empowerment programme, he has over 54 completed and ongoing projects across the 23 wards that make up the constituency. “It is not about winning elections but fulfilling your campaign promises. Again, we are fulfilling part of our campaign promises,” he said. “This is just my commitment to the people of Ovia federal constituency, but also my commitment to God and to change the narrative of the past. “Ovia has seen the light; gone are the days when you turn what is meant for the people to yourself. “By the time we are done, whoever that will come on must perform, or they will be stoned.” Sunday Aghedo, member-elect of the state house of assembly, described Idahosa as an effective representative of the Ovia federal constituency. “There have been others before him, but they failed to do what Idahosa is doing now. He has set a standard that those coming after him will strive hard to achieve,” Aghedo said. “What he is doing today is unprecedented in the history of Ovia federal constituency.” On his part, Lawrence Okah, APC secretary in the state, urged the beneficiaries to effectively maintain the motorcycles. “These motorcycles will enable you all to work and take care of your families,” he said.
