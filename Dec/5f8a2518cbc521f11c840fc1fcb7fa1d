The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the arrest of Uche Nwosu, former governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in Imo, during a church service in the state. Nwosu was arrested on Sunday, but was released hours later from police custody. Following his release, the former governorship candidate said he wasn’t invited before the arrest. He also alleged that his arrest was politically motivated. CAN, in a statement on Thursday signed by Adebayo Oladeji, its spokeman, said it condemns in “strong terms” the arrest of Nwosu at the St. Peter’s Anglican Cathedral Umunwokwe village, in Eziama-Obieri Nkwerre LGA. The association said it is “highly embarrassed” by the development, adding that it feels “pained that the Nigeria Police had no respect even for the house of God”. “We cannot remember whether this act of disrespect for God ever happened before in our country,” the statement reads. “The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has nothing to apologise for over what the police did because we were never and would never be party to their horrendous act. The Police that did the disgraceful thing should appropriately apologise without giving any excuse. We expect them to be more circumspect in the performance of their duties. “We are not asking the Police or the security agencies not to do their constitutional duties, but the idea of desecrating the House of God in doing so is totally unacceptable, unfortunate and reprehensible. “In view of the foregoing, we urge the Inspector General of Police to call his men to order and continue to respect all houses of worship, whether church or mosque. This type of act should never happen again in our country.”
