Three suspected kidnappers have been arrested by hunters at Adavi LGA of Kogi state. The alleged kidnappers, who had reportedly been terrorising Osara, Aku, Irepeni, Irapana, and Okene-Lokoja highway were arrested on Wednesday by hunters in an operation led by by Joseph Omuya, the council chairman. The alleged kidnappers were said to have come to the highway around 8pm at Ali Farm Centre to carry out their operation, but were intercepted by hunters who were on duty at that time. Some of the gang members were said to have escaped with bullets wounds during a gun duel. One of them was said to have confessed of their mode of operation, the nature of weapons they use, and the names of other gang members. While commending the hunters for their effort, Omuya appealed to every resident particularly those residing in farming areas to be security-conscious. Yahaya Bello, Kogi state governor, had recently asked the national assembly to expedite the passage of the hunters bill 2020. The governor said using hunters to combat crime in Kogi is one of the reasons the state has made progress in tackling insecurity.
