According to NAN, Ibrahim Ali, commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), disclosed this on Wednesday when he received members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Jos. Mato was abducted by gunmen from his residence on December 26. According to Ali, members of the special task force have been mobilised to the area for a search-and-rescue operation. He added that some persons suspected to be connected to the case have been apprehended. “The abductors of the traditional ruler have called and demanded a ransom of N500 million to secure his release. We have arrested some suspects. They are in our custody,” he said. “These are people we feel have knowledge of the incident. We have picked them up and they are being interrogated. “Kidnapping is one of the major problems in this country. It is increasing on a daily basis. You can be kidnapped by anybody, anytime and anywhere. “But we are working round the clock and have put modalities on ground to end the menace.” He expressed concern over the increased level of kidnapping and assured citizens that the security operatives are working to tackle the situation.
