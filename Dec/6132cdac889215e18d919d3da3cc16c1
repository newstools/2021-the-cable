Troops of the Nigerian Army have recovered gun trucks from suspected fighters of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Buni Yadi, Gujba LGA of Yobe state. The insurgents were said to have mounted gun trucks and advanced towards the town on Tuesday when the soldiers engaged them. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, in a statement on Wednesday, said the army was supported by the air force and the police. “Troops of Sector 2 Joint Task Force, North East (NE), Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) have again inflicted casualty on Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in a fierce battle that ensued in Buni Yadi in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State on Tuesday, 30 November 2021,” the statement reads. “The terrorists, who frantically attempted to gain access into Buni Yadi mounted on gun trucks, met stiff resistance from troops of 27 Task Force Brigade and Nigerian Army Special Forces School, supported by the Nigerian Air Force Component and personnel of the Nigerian Police, who gallantly fought and overwhelmed the terrorists with superior firepower. “The ferocious battle forced the criminals to withdraw in different directions having suffered heavy losses. “Several gun trucks with their occupants were taken out by the troops. Preliminary battle damage assessment revealed the precision with which air and land troops engaged the terrorists destroying their gun trucks. Exploitation is still ongoing by troops to take out fleeing remnants of the terrorists. “Commending troops for this operational exploit, the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, charged them to sustain the current operational tempo to deny the criminals freedom of action.” The Yobe town came into limelight in 2014 when insurgents attacked and killed 58 students of the Federal Government College, Buni Yadi.
