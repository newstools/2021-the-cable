He said the cause of the fire was not yet known as further investigation would be carried out. Sandra Emeka, a witness at the scene, told NAN that she was at the gate of the supermarket trying to gain entrance to the compound when she noticed dark smoke coming out of the store. “I don’t know where the fire started from or what caused it, but I just noticed the smoke and heard people around telling us to move back that there was fire,” she said. Philip Paul, another customer, expressed sadness over the incident as he described the supermarket as a “big shopping centre”. “It is so unfortunate this happened at this time when the store must have been stocked up for the festive season,” he said. “This is a great loss, and I sympathise with the management of this supermarket.”
