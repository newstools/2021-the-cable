Simon Odo, a native doctor popularly known as ‘King of Satan’, who married 59 wives and had over 300 children and grandchildren is dead. The late Odo, who is from Aji in Igbo-Eze north LGA of Enugu state, was said to have died in the early hours of Tuesday after a brief illness. Confirming the death to NAN on Tuesday, Emeka Odo, one of his sons, said his father died at the age of 74. He said burial arrangements are already in progress in compliance with his father’s instruction to the wives and children that his remains should not be deposited in a mortuary when confirmed dead, but that he should be buried as soon as possible. “Yes, my father popularly known as King of Satan is dead. He died on Tuesday morning as he had been sick for the past three weeks,” he said. “We are holding family meetings to perfect arrangements for his burial since he instructed us not to put his body in a mortuary.” He said the death of his father was a big blow as the late Odo was a “loving and caring father” in spite of the large number of his family members. “Since this morning that my father died, kinsmen, friends and well-wishers have been trooping in shock and surprise to come and sympathise with our family,” he added.
