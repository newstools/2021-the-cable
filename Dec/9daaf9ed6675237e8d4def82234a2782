The federal executive council (FEC) has approved an “enhanced” Federal Civil Service Strategy and Implementation Plan (FCSSIP 2021-2025). The plan is dubbed “new civil service of our dream”. Folasade Yemi-Esan, head of the civil service, disclosed this on Wednesday at the end of the FEC meeting held at the presidential villa in Abuja. Yemi-Esan said the plan was the outcome of the contributions of the organised private sector (OPS), serving and retired professionals of the civil service, labour unions and associations, as well as development partners. According to her, the strategy is aimed at achieving a world-class civil service for “accelerated national development”. “I am convinced that the implementation of the initiatives itemised in the plan will galvanise the service to greater heights,” she said. Yemi-Esan urged stakeholders to study and ensure the effective implementation of the plan to enhance service delivery and engender economic growth and sustainable development. She thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his support to the civil service and for ensuring that despite the COVID pandemic, no civil servant was owed salaries. The head of service also thanked Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and the members of the committee on the development of FCSSIP25. “She equally appreciated the African Initiative for Governance (AIG) and the World Bank for their support in the development of the FCSSIP25,” AbdulGaniyu Aminu, spokesman to Yemi-Esan, quoted her as saying.
