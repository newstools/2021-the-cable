Cristiano Ronaldo scored a second half penalty as Manchester United beat Norwich City 1-0 at Carrow Road on Saturday evening. The 36-year-old’s strike handed Ralf Rangnick, Man United’s interim manager, successive league wins two matches into his tenure. A tepid first period saw Man United with the better opportunities, with Ronaldo fluffing his lines when he should have scored. The former Juventus striker however dealt the telling blow to Norwich, EPL’s basement club, when he was brought down by Max Aarons, and Portugal’s record goalscorer dispatched with aplomb. Norwich came to life afterwards but were met by an inspired David de Gea in Man United’s goal, denying the Canaries several opportunities to snatch a point, keeping consecutive clean sheets for the first time this season. The Red Devils climb to fifth on the EPL table, level on 27 points with West Ham United who have played a game less. In other matches, penalties were also the order of the day for the trio of Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, with the EPL title contenders needing spot kicks to claim full points. Raheem Sterling’s penalty from a contentious handball was enough for Man City to overcome 10-man Wolves at the Etihad, while Mohamed Salah delivered same at Anfield in Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Aston Villa. Chelsea however required two spot kicks for a 3-2 win over Leeds United.
