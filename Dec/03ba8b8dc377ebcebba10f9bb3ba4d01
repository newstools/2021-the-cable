Neyen Williams, a 400-level undergraduate of the faculty of law, has been elected as president of The Literary and Debating Society, University of Ibadan (UI), Oyo state. The 20-year-old student, who hails from Akwa-Ibom, won the election held on December 18 at the Kenneth Mellanby hall junior common room. She was sworn in as the eighth president of the society on Monday alongside other elected executives of the society. Adebayo Abdulrahman, recipient of the best rookie award at the just concluded Jaw war, was elected vice-president; Ugochukwu Chineke, general-secretary; and Akinleye Goodness, public relations officer. In a chat with TheCable, Williams said she intends to build an excellent literary culture and sustain the legacy of past leaderships of the society. “First, I am happy to have emerged 8th President of this Society, especially that I’ll be the 3rd Female President in the history of the Society,” she said. “It has always been my desire to serve and having been a part of the last administration, I was able to exude certain leadership traits that I think can help me steer the wheel of the organisation greatly, hence building on the legacies of past administrations. “As a forward-thinking leader, I will remain committed to solidifying structures that have been put in place from years back; propel the spirit of excellent literary culture amongst its members and ensure that the standard of the most anticipated debate tournament, which doubles as the biggest public speaking competition in West Africa — Jaw War, remains unrelegated.”
