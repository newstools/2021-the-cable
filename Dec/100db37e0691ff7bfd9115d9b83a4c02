Emmanuel Dennis, Super Eagles striker, scored but could not prevent his Watford side from losing 2-1 to Chelsea in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at Vicarage Road on Wednesday night. The 24-year-old striker scored two minutes before halftime to cancel Mason Mount’s earlier strike. The goal is the former Club Brugge striker’s sixth of the season as the Nigerian has now scored in three successive league matches for the first time since 2017 while at the Belgian club. Following strikes against Leicester and Manchester United in recent weeks, Dennis’ goal came off Chelsea losing possession in their half, and the summer signing’s shot took a deflection off Antonio Rudiger before finding the bottom corner. Hakim Ziyech, however, netted the winner on the 72nd minute to ensure Chelsea returned to winning ways and remain top of the EPL. Liverpool and Manchester City also maintained the hunt for the top spot with wins away from home. Jurgen Klopp’s side thrashed Everton 4-1 in the Merseyside derby with Mohamed Salah scoring a brace, while Pep Guardiola’s City overcame Aston Villa 2-1 to end Steven Gerrard winning start to life as an EPL manager.
