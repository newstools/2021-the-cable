Barcelona crashed out of the UEFA Champions League (UCL) following a 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night. The defeat means Barcelona have been eliminated at the group stage for the first time in 21 years. First-half goals from Thomas Muller and Leroy Sane, and a second-half strike from youngster Jamal Musiala ensured Barcelona were sent packing from the competition. Bayern Munich’s win ensured the German champions also finished the group stage with a perfect record of six wins from six matches, joining Liverpool and Ajax Amsterdam in this season’s elite group of clubs with a 100% record. Muller’s looping header awarded by the goal-line technology set the tone before Sane found the net from 25 yards with a ferocious shot which goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen should have saved. Musiala converted a cutback from Alphonse Davies to add more gloss to a deserved victory over a timid Barcelona side. In the first games of the day, Timo Werner (brace) and Romelu Lukaku were on the scoresheet but Chelsea conceded a last-gasp goal to concede victory, settling for a 3-3 draw at Zenit St. Petersburg in Russia. Coupled with Juventus’ 1-0 win in Turin, the draw sees the European champions lose the top spot in the group to the Italian side. RESULTS
