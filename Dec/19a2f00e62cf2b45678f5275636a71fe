Mikel Arteta, Arsenal FC manager, has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the Gunners’ upcoming English Premier League (EPL) match against Manchester City. The North London club disclosed their Spanish manager’s condition in a statement on Wednesday. “Mikel Arteta will miss our match against Manchester City on New Year’s Day after testing positive for COVID-19,” the statement read. “Mikel is isolating in line with Government guidelines and we wish him well.” This is the second time Arteta will be testing positive for the novel coronavirus. His first bout with the deadly virus happened in March 2020. Arsenal are on a four-game winning streak in the league, a form that has propelled the Champions League hopefuls into the highly coveted fourth position. The Gunners have also progressed to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and it remains to be seen the impact of Arteta’s absence on Arsenal’s newfound form. Arsenal are slated to host Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on January 1, 2022.
