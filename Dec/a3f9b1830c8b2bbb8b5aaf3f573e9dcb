The senate has extended the tenure of the 2021 budget to March 31, 2022, following a request by President Muhammadu Buhari. The letter was read on the floor of the upper legislative chamber by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday. Buhari asked the national assembly for “virement” of the 2021 budget. After the president’s letter was read, the senate quickly passed it for second and third reading — and the exercise was done in less than 30 minutes. In his request, the president said he sought an extension of the 2021 budget till March because his administration is looking to fund “critical and urgent” needs provided for the appropriation bill. Buhari said his request would enhance his administration’s efforts to improve the wellbeing of Nigerians. “The 2021 budget presentation implementation has areas that will need additional funding for some critical and urgent line items in the budget,” the letter reads. “In the light of the above, I implore the senate to consider the virement proposals to support our efforts to improve the wellbeing of our citizens.” The national assembly also approved N13.588 trillion as the federal government’s expenditure for 2021. Buhari signed the 2021 bill on December 31, 2020.
