Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, has directed any aspirant in his administration seeking to contest the governorship position of the state in the forthcoming election to resign no later than December 18. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has scheduled the Ekiti governorship poll for June 18, 2022. Biodun Oyebanji, chief of staff; and Biodun Omoleye, commissioner for public utilities, are some of those said to be nursing ambitions to contest the governorship election next year. In a statement on Wednesday, Yinka Oyebode, chief press secretary to the governor, said Fayemi wants to ensure “cohesion and excellent service delivery” are not compromised. “[It] became imperative in order to ensure cohesion and excellent service delivery – two major hallmarks of the administration – remain uncompromised,” Oyebode said. Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed the Ekiti governorship primary for January 2022.
