Iyorchia Ayu, chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says any member who works against the party will face the consequences. NAN quoted Ayu as saying this on Monday at a meeting with PDP members from Ekiti state at the party’s secretariat in Abuja. The chairman said every member should be ready to support any candidate the party picks for an election. “Once the party decides on the candidate, it is the responsibility of every member of the PDP family to fight for that candidate because you are not just fighting for that candidate you are fighting for the PDP,” he said. “So, you have a responsibility to support him. Anybody that does otherwise will be considered as working against the PDP. It will be regarded as anti-party. “The mood of the PDP today is that anybody who works against the PDP will not just walk away because we do not want members of our party fighting against members of the party. “We lost elections because the leaders in various states and the followership were divided, with PDP winning or losing against PDP. That trend has to stop. “We are very certain that the reconciliation process which we are going to carry out in virtually every state will enable us to unify the party at the ward, local government and state levels.” Ayu said victory is only assured if the party works as a team. “The governors must work with their colleagues, critical stakeholders right from the ward,” he said. “Every other party leader in every state must be prepared to work as a team player, because party politics is like football, it is not tennis. “It is only when you work as a team that you are assured of victory.”
