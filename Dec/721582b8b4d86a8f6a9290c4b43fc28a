Maduka Okoye, Super Eagles goalkeeper, has taken to social media to pen a heartfelt farewell message to Gernot Rohr. Rohr was dismissed from his role as the Super Eagles head coach on Sunday due to poor performances. Amaju Pinnick, president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), had said the Franco-German was sacked as quick prevention “before disaster starts happening” to the team. But in a tweet on his verified Twitter account on Monday, Okoye said he has “nothing but praise and gratitude” for Rohr. He also credited the 63-year-old for turning his career around and helping him fulfill his dream of representing Nigeria. “You turned my young football career around, helped me and gave this career a big boost! You let me do what I always dreamed of, Playing for my fatherland Nigeria. Thank you for almost three amazing years, your support and your trust. I’m wishing you all the best, Coach Rohr,” he wrote. Okoye made his international debut under Rohr in a friendly against Brazil in November 2019. He has gone on to make another 15 caps for the Super Eagles while securing himself the position of the first-choice goalkeeper. The 22-year-old’s club career also enjoyed a huge leap as he moved from Fortuna Düsseldorf II to Sparta Rotterdam and, recently, to Watford in the English Premier League.
