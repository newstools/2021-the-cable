The Yuletide season is a time to show love, not just to loved ones, but to the underserved and underprivileged. This led Women Connect, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and community for women, to reach out to children at the Centre for Destitute Empowerment International in Idimu, Lagos on Wednesday. Oyinlola Sale, chief executive officer of Women Connect, emphasised the need to show love and care to the less opportune. “We decided to have a special Christmas with these children because they deserve a special treat and we have come to remind them that there is light at the end of the tunnel and we believe these are the people that need our help the most,” Sale said. Sale said there is a need for impact to be made not just seasonally but regularly while calling on the government to do more in supporting persons with disabilities. “We have come to preach hope to these children and believe that despite their inabilities or deformities, they can live a normal life. These children do not just need food and clothing but some of them need school fees to support their education, some need wheelchairs, some need to undergo operations and this will require both money and lots of encouragement,” she added. “When I was told that this kind of outreach is only done during the yuletide season, I felt bad. It is our responsibility not just as a group but as a society and even the government to pay more attention to these ones as it is not their fault that they are like this.” Alice Okoliko, matron of the centre, said the children need support in the area of accommodation and education. She said: “We are tired of paying rent and do not have enough space to carry out the work we have been given to do. We, therefore, plead with the government to support us with a place of our own so we can have more rooms and even a school for the special ones amongst these children.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-644873" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-30-at-12.33.55-PM-2-e1640865032576.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="270" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-644872" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-30-at-12.33.55-PM-1-e1640865003863.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="270" />
