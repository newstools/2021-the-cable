The All Progressives Congress (APC) says Nigerians are “too intelligent” to allow the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) take over power in 2023. Speaking on Thursday at a meeting with state caretaker chairmen of the APC in Abuja, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the party’s caretaker committee, said Nigerians will choose his party. The state chairmen passed a vote of confidence on the Mai Mala Buni-led national caretaker committee. Speaking on the recent comment by Iyorchia Ayu, chairman of the PDP, who had said the ruling party had “failed”, Akpanudoedehe said APC as a preferred choice is evident in Nigerians voting his party in bye-elections. “Nigerian youths are very brilliant, resourceful people. We had said to ourselves that we were not going to respond because it is not an issue,” he said. “But we must be very careful not to arm PDP with the bullets against our party. I learnt that the new PDP chairman made a prophecy that we will scatter before April. “Let me send a message to PDP. If we are talking about replacing APC, it can never be the PDP because Nigerians are too intelligent. Nigerians will still choose APC. “Talk is cheap. Even when they sponsored crises throughout Nigeria, we won most bye-elections. We inherited insurgency and we have dealt with it. As we speak, not one inch of Nigeria’s territory is being taken over by any group. When PDP was in government, they took over everywhere but today, it is different.” Akpanudoedehe said the current administration’s social programmes are the best the country has seen. “Maybe because the president is not the talking type,” he said. “I am challenging anyone to show me any social intervention programme better than this government. People are collecting alerts for COVID-19 palliatives. Youths, women, civil servants are collecting it.”
