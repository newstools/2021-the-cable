Isa Ashiru, the 2019 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna, has declared interest in contesting the seat of the governor in the next election. TheCable had reported how Ashiru lost to Nasir el-Rufai of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019. The PDP had, however, rejected the result of the election and accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of conspiring with the APC. Ashiru, who said he “intends to pursue his ambition until success is achieved”, added that his journey into politics is to serve humanity and provide the dividends of democracy to the people. “In politics, when you lose the first time, it is not a loss. This game is not about me but about my people,” he said. “I have a vision which I believe, if given the opportunity, will transform the lives of my people for the better. “So, I am not in politics to serve myself but to serve my people. Things have changed. I feel I have something better to offer to improve the economic and social condition of our people. That is why I am going to run again. “My desire is to ensure that all parts of the state feel the impact of governance and to provide the needed security in the state and run an all-inclusive government with the fear of God.”
