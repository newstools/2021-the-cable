Kingsley Chinda, a member of the house of representatives, says the suffering caused by the “incompetent All Progressives Congress-led government” made life difficult for Nigerians. Chinda claimed that Christmas was not celebrated with fanfare because of “glaring hunger and economic hardship” in the country. He is currently the leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the house of representatives. He said despite the suffering, Nigerians should be resilient and hope for a “better and greater” Nigeria. In a Christmas message to his constituents, the lawmaker said Nigerians should use the season to reflect on the virtues “Christ lived and died for”. “As Christians across the globe celebrate this year’s Christmas, I hereby for myself, my family and constituents rejoice and felicitate with them, particularly Nigerians and that resident in Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency,” the statement reads. “Clearly, Christmas comes with bliss, fanfare and happy moments. But what bliss, fanfare and happy moments can we truly say Nigerians are having in the face of glaring hunger, economic hardship, rising cost/standard of living, kidnappings, killings and general insecurity across the country, occasioned by a clueless, inept APC led Federal Government? “This question leaves us with the reality that as we mark this year’s Christmas, we must more than ever before, be pragmatic, take stock, uphold the truth at all times and reflect deeply on the virtues of love for one another, sacrifice and perseverance, some of the virtues that Jesus Christ lived and died for. “Indeed, we must remain positive and resilient in the face of these challenges and hope for a better and greater Nigeria.”
