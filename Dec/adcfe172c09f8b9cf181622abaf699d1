Simi Olusola, executive director of The Nigerian Alliance (TNA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), says it will sponsor 15 young people seeking legislative seats in 2023. Speaking with reporters on Thursday in Abuja after organising a workshop for the aspirants, Olusola said TNA is committed to transforming politics in the country. He said the organisation would be providing aspirants funds and strategy for their campaigns if they emerge candidates. “What we are providing for candidates, we are doing campaign strategy development, we are going to support them in managing it, putting your campaign team together, paying for your campaign team needs, your logistics support, any empowerment or data and research you need to do,” she said. “Security, health logistics… we are providing all that for the candidate.” On his part, Anthony Ehilebo, a facilitator at the event, said the model was copied from the US. “We did not invent it. We are just borrowing a leaf from the US after an American aspirant at the time, Bernie Sanders, lost the election, a group of people in the Democratic circle decided that they needed to take things a little bit further,” he said. “They formed what is called the Justice Democratic Alliance, a policy action committee, and decided to sponsor candidates to congress, candidates they felt aligned with a specific set of goals. “That was the path we decided to tow.” The 15 aspirants are; Oseyili Anenih, Simi Olusola, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, Rock Amegor, Norris Campbell, Oke Staylf, Iguodala Obaseki, Abdul-Azeez Akinsanya, Jude Feranmi, Michael Adewara, Mangka Mangni, Chomo Datiyi, Timi Iyela, Opeyemi Oladunjoye and Bamidele Abiola.
