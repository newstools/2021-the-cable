Seyi Tinubu, chairman, Loatsad Promomedia, has called on Nigerian youths to unite and play active roles in politics. Tinubu spoke at the third edition of the annual Maktoub Youth Forum in Abuja on Wednesday. The event was tagged ‘Re-Inventing Youths’ with the slogan, ‘We Can, We Will’. Tinubu said the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for youths to be creative and also realise that “they are better together”. He said the lockdown resulted in the emergence of several youth-led digital platforms in addition to many innovative ventures. On his part, Hakeem Shagaya, CEO of Karmod Nigeria, urged the youths to form an alliance and be politically active at the local level. “We must learn to collaborate because it is through that we can have bigger voices and motive of what we want to achieve. Unionisation is one of the ways to effect changes and solutions,” Shagaya said. Also speaking, Frank Mba, spokesperson of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), enjoined the youth and the public to trust the police as modern policing derives its legitimacy from the public. Maryam Maktoub, the convener of the event, urged young people to avoid social media tension “because 80 percent of people on social media live fake life”. She also tasked youths to be involved in politics and pick a leader among themselves. “The event encourages Nigerian youths to discover, explore and maximise their natural potentials and create a better future for themselves in spite of hurdles,” she said. “It is a reaffirmation that youths can be the change they want to see and underscores the power of mentoring and experienced guidance by respected professionals and key stakeholders across different sectors of national life.”
