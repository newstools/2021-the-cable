Muhammad Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT), says closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and solar lighting will soon become mandatory for all estates in Abuja. According to a statement issued on Wednesday by Anthony Ogunleye, his spokesperson, Bello said this during the commissioning of the Cosgrove Smart Estate in Wuye. According to him, solar lights are expected to be attached to perimeter fences and streets in all estates to improve security. “Our focus will be ensuring that estates are managed properly to the benefit of the residents. Accordingly, greater emphasis will be placed on security and environmental matters,” he said. “It will be made mandatory for every estate in the FCT to deploy CCTV cameras with recording facilities and solar lights on perimeter fences and along the streets in the estates. “Furthermore, no scavengers will be allowed to be refuse collectors within estates. Each estate is expected to employ the services of reputable companies registered by the Abuja Environmental Protection Board. “I wish to remind estate developers that 40 percent of the FCT is intended to be green. This is even more critical now as we battle climate change.” The minister added that efforts would be made to ensure adequate management of all estates as the government is committed to supporting investors in the sector. He urged all estate owners to adopt the culture of planting trees, shrubs, flowers and also provide parks and gardens to beautify the city.
