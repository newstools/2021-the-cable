The All Progressives Congress (APC) says the newly-inaugurated leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has shown early signs that it is not different from its immediate past leadership. On Friday, Iyorchia Ayu was sworn in as the national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) following the removal of Uche Secondus. In a statement on Saturday, in Abuja, James Akpanudoedehe, national secretary, APC caretaker and extra-ordinary convention planning committee, said the semblance of the old and new leadership of the PDP is evident, saying the party does not portray hope of a refocused opposition party. He said the sole intent of the PDP is to grab power by any means while ignoring the need for genuine restitution. Akpanudoedehe added that the new leadership of PDP must prove to Nigerians that it is willing and ready to discard its penchant for impunity. “The sit-tight syndrome headlined by the PDP’s ill-fated third-term agenda has been discarded as an undemocratic template,” Akpanudoedehe said. “President Buhari has assured Nigerians and the international community of free and fair elections in 2023, even as he pledged peaceful transfer of power. “That is the stuff of true progressives and statesmanship. “Also, this government’s diversification policies have led to massive growth of the non-oil sector, spurring Nigeria’s highest growth in the last seven years. “Record investments in the armed forces and other security services has equipped, raised their morale and enabled them to effectively secure our lives and properties. “The old system where impunity and corruption was pervasive is no longer the norm.” He added that the priority of the APC administration had been the clearing of the “national rot” left behind by the PDP administration in 16 years.
