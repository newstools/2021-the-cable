The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) says it is investigating the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) Teaching Hospital over the alleged misappropriation of N950 million COVID intervention fund. The development was announced in a statement by the ICPC on Tuesday. The anti-graft agency said the alleged offence is a violation of the provisions of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000. “An immediate investigation by the Commission into the utilisation of the N950 million intervention fund by the teaching hospital in Port Harcourt has therefore been initiated,” the statement reads. “The commission has obtained documents from the federal ministry of health, federal ministry of finance, budget and national planning, and the University of Port Harcourt teaching hospital that would assist in its investigation of the utilisation of the COVID-19 Intervention Fund by the health institutions.” The federal government had reportedly earmarked the sum of N950 million each for 52 federal teaching hospitals and medical centres. The sums approved are said to be for the building and furnishing of molecular laboratories, isolation centres, 10-bed intensive care units (ICUs) and procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE).
