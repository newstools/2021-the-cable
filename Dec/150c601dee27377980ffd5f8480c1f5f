Gboyega Akosile, chief press secretary to the Lagos governor, says the students of the Lagos State University (LASU) have agreed to participate in the peace walk proposed by the government. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, had on Tuesday proposed “a walk for peace” with selected celebrities, civil society organisations, the media and other groups for the “healing” of the state after the #EndSARS protest. Sanwo-Olu had unveiled the new LASU students’ arcade on Thursday. In a statement, Akosile said Oladipupo Badmus, student union president of LASU, commended the governor for his efforts towards rebuilding the state. “To Mr. Governor, sir, it is what you signed up for but we are indebted to you. Be rest assured, whenever you walk, we will work with you. We will be by your side. Whenever you run, we will run with you to the end,” Badmus was quoted as saying. On his part, the governor urged the students to support the state government and the management of the institution in order to maintain healthy competition with other universities. “I want to tell you that we are in this journey together and together, we will build the biggest university in the whole of Africa and it will compete with the greatest universities in the entire world,” Sanwo-Olu said. “I feel highly honoured that all of you have turned out in large numbers to come and see the possibilities of what we can do collectively. “This arcade will provide the right atmosphere for the leadership of the Student Union of LASU and opportunity for student-management better relationship. “It would provide an opportunity to engage with the wonderful youths in LASU, because this is also a building to develop the future leaders that are leaders here today.”
