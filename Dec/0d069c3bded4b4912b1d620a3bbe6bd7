A federal high court in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, has sentenced one Olugbenga Ogunrinde to 10 months in prison for impersonating Iga Swiatek, a popular tennis player from Poland. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Ogunrinde on charges bordering on “fraudulent impersonation”. “That you, Ogunrinde Olugbenga Akanbi “M” on or about the 11th day of February, 2021 within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court fraudulently impersonated one Iga Swiatek, a female Tennis player from Warsaw, Poland via your Facebook account with Gmail address swiatekiga105@gmail.com, with intent to gain monetary advantage for yourself and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 22(2)(b)(i) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Act, 2015 and punishable under Section 22(2)(b) of the same Act,” the charge sheet reads. According to a statement by the EFCC, at the court sitting presided over by Uche Agomoh on Thursday, Ogunrinde was found guilty. “Ogunrinde who has already refunded the sum of $300 USD (Three Hundred United States Dollars) to his victim through the Federal Government of Nigeria, also forfeits one Tecno Spark 4 mobile phone and a small itel phone to the federal government of Nigeria,” the statement reads.
