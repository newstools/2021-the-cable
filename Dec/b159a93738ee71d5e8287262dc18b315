Radio Now 95.3FM, the radio station owned by Kadaria Ahmed, marked its first anniversary on Wednesday. Ahmed, a journalist and media entrepreneur, is the chief executive officer of Radio Now 95.3FM. The radio station commenced operations in December 2020 to provide factual, unbiased, and Nigerian-focused news. Speaking on the journey so far, Ahmed said: “We did it with the support of our audience and of course those who put their money and resources behind us by sponsoring programs and advertising. “Our stellar board of directors are our backbone and have been outstanding. Our profound gratitude to everyone who has been on this journey with us.” Muhtar Bakare, chairman, RadioNow95.3FM, and other staff were present at the commemoration of the anniversary.
