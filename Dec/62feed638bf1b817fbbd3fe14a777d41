Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Manchester United came from a goal down to claim a 3-2 victory over Arsenal in their English Premier League clash at Old Trafford on Thursday night. The Portuguese gave Man United the lead at 2-1 with a side footed finish to make history as the first professional footballer to score 800 goals. It was also the former Juventus man’s 129th league goal for Man United. Ronaldo then added his 130th from the penalty spot on 70 minutes — which proved to be the match winner. Arsenal had scored the first goal in a controversial circumstance in the 13th minutes through Emile Smith Rowe who converted while David De Gea, Man United goalkeeper, lay injured on the turf by his own player, with the video assistant referee (VAR) awarding the goal. Bruno Fernandes equalised before Ronaldo scored his record-breaking goal after which Martin Odegaard briefly made it 2-2. The Red Devils are up to seventh on the EPL table with 21 points from 14 matches, two behind Arsenal in fifth place. RESULTS
