Muhammad Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT), says the recent attack at the University of Abuja (UNIABUJA) staff quarters was “planned to gain publicity”. Gunmen had attacked the staff quarters of the university on November 2, shooting sporadically and abducting six persons. Those abducted were Joseph Obansa, a professor of economics, and his son; Ferguson Tobins, a lecturer in the department of engineering; Sambo Mohammed, a senior non-academic staff, and two children of Bassey Ubom, a professor at the institution. The abductors had contacted the families of the victims, demanding a ransom of N300 million. The victims have, however, regained their freedom. In a statement signed by Anthony Ogunleye, chief press secretary to the minister, Bello said the attack was done in order to cast doubt on the security in place in the nation’s capital. The minister was quoted to have said this to members of the governing council of the University of Abuja, during their courtesy visit led by Ahmed Muhammed, chairman and pro-chancellor. “Speaking on the recent kidnap of some staff of the university by armed men, the minister commended the university authorities, especially the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Abdul Rasheed Na’Allah, for the roles they played in solving the crime,” the statement reads. “He said the kidnap attempt was a well-planned attack targeted at the city of Abuja and it was the intention of the criminals to get maximum publicity owing to the strategic nature of the city and raise doubts as to the security situation within the nation’s capital. “As a result of cracking that case, the minister added that several other planned attacks were prevented from being executed.”
