The Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) has launched multiple rocket attacks on Maiduguri, Borno state capital. The insurgents launched the attacks on Thursday ahead of President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to the city to inaugurate projects done by the state government . The explosives landed in several areas which include Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari and Ayafe communities within the metropolis. The insurgents were said to have launched the attack from the outskirt of Auno which is about 15 kilometres away from the city. Residents within the area scampered for safety amid sounds of explosion. The casualty figure is yet to be ascertained but many houses were destroyed. The president arrived in Maiduguri around 11am as part of a one-day official visit to Borno. The president was received by Babagana Zulum, governor of the state, Usman Kadafur, his deputy, members of national and state houses of assembly, and some top government officials. Other dignitaries that received the president were Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff, and Christopher Musa, theatre commander of operation Hadin Kai. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, was not immediately available to comment on the attack.
