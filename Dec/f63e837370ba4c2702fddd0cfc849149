A woman and her two daughters died on Sunday in an accident at Itako, Ijebu-Ife in Ogun state. Babatunde Akinbiyi, spokesperson of Ogun state’s Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), said the accident involved a truck and a Ford jeep. Akinbiyi said the Ford jeep rammed into the truck which was parked by the side of the road. Out of the four persons in the car, three died. “The Ford jeep was on its way from Lagos to the eastern part on vacation when it rammed into a stationary Dangote truck from behind due to excessive speed and loss of control,” Akinbiyi said. “The husband of the woman stays overseas and the driver was employed as the family driver. “The driver is at the police station.” Akinbiyi said the corpses of the deceased have been taken to the morgue of Goshen Hospital, Ijebu Ife. He said the vehicles involved had been taken to Ijebu Ife divisional police station. He commiserated with the family of the deceased and advised drivers to avoid excessive speed and dangerous driving.
