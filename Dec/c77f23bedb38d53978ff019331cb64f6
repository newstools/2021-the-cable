Mohammed Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT), has tested positive for COVID-19. Bello announced his status in a statement posted on his Facebook page on Friday. The minister said he started feeling sick on Tuesday and subsequently took the test. “After a hide and seek period spanning 21 months (1yr 9 months) between COVID-19 and my humble self, the virus finally caught up with me during the dying days of 2021. After feeling unwell since 28th December, I decided to do a COVID-19 test yesterday morning,” he said. “The result came out positive this morning. Currently doing fine, with some sore throat, feverish feeling, and mild running nose. Undertaking treatment and isolation at home.” The minister praised medical personnel in the nation’s capital who have been making efforts to curb the spread of the virus. “I salute and wish all the medical personnel in the FCT and beyond who have been in the front line fighting this pandemic a happy and prosperous new year 2022. I pray for the quick recovery of all of us currently afflicted with COVID-19,” he said. “I have been informed by the experts that my case is mild because I took two shots of the COVID-19 vaccine.” The minister appealed to persons “who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 to do so”.
