Merck, a leading science and technology company, has announced that its life science business sector has signed an agreement with Innovative Biotech (IB) to support the establishment of a vaccine production facility in Nigeria. Innovative Biotech operates from Keffi, Nasarawa state as well as the US. In a statement on Tuesday, Merck said the collaboration is part of the West African pandemic readiness programme, which aims to localise vaccine development in African nations. It said the first phase of the partnership focuses on designing the fill and finish facility and incorporating a single-use technology, while the second phase will focus on enabling continuous manufacturing. According to the statement, Andrew Bulpin, head of process solutions in the life science business sector, said the collaboration is a testament to the company’s commitment to expanding access of patients worldwide to life-saving and life-enhancing therapies. “We are proud to provide the technical support and expertise that could help enable the first vaccine facility in Nigeria and localise vaccine development in the West Africa region,” he said. The federal government, on several occasions, had expressed its commitment towards the commencement of vaccine production in Nigeria. In January, Osagie Ehanire, minister of health, said the N10 billion had been approved to support local production of the COVID vaccine.
