The Katsina police command says its operatives have arrested a 45-year-old man, identified as Sani Mamuda, for “supplying arms to bandits” in Katsina and Zamfara. Gambo Isah, Katsina police spokesman, disclosed this while parading the suspect on Thursday at the police headquarters in Katsina. He said the suspect was arrested on Wednesday while on his way to Zamfara to allegedly deliver two AK-47 rifles and two magazines loaded with 42 rounds of 7.62 mm live ammunition. Isah said the suspect concealed the weapons underneath the seat of a motorcycle he was riding to Zamfara. “On December 22, 2021, at about 7:30 pm, based on credible intelligence, DPO, Kurfi division, and his team accosted Mamuda of Birnin Magaji LGA of Zamfara state,” the police spokesman said. “Mamuda, a notorious bandit and arms dealer who specialises in supplying weapons to bandits in the forests of Katsina and Zamfara states, was arrested along Kurfi-Batsari road while on transit from Katsina to Zamfara. “Other items allegedly found on Mamuda were 12,000 CFR, N49,500, one Tecno handset and two Airtel SIM cards. “Mamuda confessed to have bought the two rifles at Mashi forest from one Masa’idu and one Abdullahi, who are now at large.” He added that the suspect would be arraigned in court after investigation is concluded. While responding to questions, the suspect confessed that he was taking the weapons to some bandits in Zamfara. According to Mamuda, he makes a profit ranging “between N50,000 and N80,000 on each rifle sold”. “The urge to make ends meet made me go into the business about two years ago. I only supply weapons to bandits. I have never killed people with these weapons,” he added.
