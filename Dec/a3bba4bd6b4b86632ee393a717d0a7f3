President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to support the present administration in its efforts to tackle the security challenges facing the country. Buhari said this in reaction to the killing of travellers following an attack by suspected bandits in Gidan Bawa village in Isa LGA of Sokoto state. A total of 23 travellers were said to have been burnt to death when the gunmen opened fire on the bus. According to a statement issued on Wednesday by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, Buhari condemned the attack and called for collective efforts to tackle the “evil” of banditry in the country. “I am very distressed at the manner of death visited on these hapless citizens who were undertaking a legitimate journey to another part of the country,” the statement reads. “It shows that the evil this administration is confronting is one that requires the support and involvement of all Nigerians. “I extend deep condolences to the families of the victims as I assure that the security agencies will continue to give their all to bring to an end the operations of these despicable people.” Also speaking on the development in a statement on Wednesday, Muhammad Bello, spokesperson to Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, said six persons sustained injuries and are receiving medical treatment, while three travellers have been discharged.
