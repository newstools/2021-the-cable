Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff, has ordered the release of Sofiyat Akinlabi, the female soldier detained for accepting a corps member’s marriage proposal while on official duty. Sofiyat had accepted a marriage proposal from a male corps member at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp in Yikpata, Kwara state. According to NAN, the army chief ordered Sofiyat’s release from detention in the spirit of Christmas. NAN quoted a source as saying the soldier had been warned and reprimanded for breaching the extant rule guiding the conduct of military personnel. The army had earlier said Sofiyat violated military rules and regulations by getting involved in a public display of an amorous relationship with a paramilitary trainee. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesman, said her offences include fraternisation while on official duty and indulging in romance while in uniform. The army spokesman added that the soldier’s conduct was prejudicial to good order and military discipline. He said if the soldier was male, the public would have interpreted the action to mean he was taking advantage of a corps member put in his care. Sofiyat was detained after the video clips of the proposal went viral on social media. Several groups and individuals had advocated for her release, with over 1,000 persons signing a petition asking the Nigerian army to set her free.
