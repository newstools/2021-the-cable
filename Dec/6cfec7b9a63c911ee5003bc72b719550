A retired soldier has been reportedly killed, while over 20 people were abducted by bandits in an attack on Angwan Gwari, a suburb of Sabon Tasha area in Kaduna metropolis. The incident, according to a resident of the area who didn’t want to be named, occurred around 9pm on Tuesday. He said the bandits were dressed in military uniforms and armed. “It was at about 9pm when we heard sounds of gunshots. Initially, we thought it was ‘knockout’ from the boys in the community until we realised that it was bandits that had invaded and residents were alerted,” he said. The resident added that he tried to contact Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, but calls and a message got no response. “I then called my classmate who is a retired assistant inspector-general of police (AIG) who is resident in Kaduna and he alerted the commandant of the strike force,” he said. “Unfortunately, before the security personnel came, a retired soldier was killed by the bandits. “They left with over 22 people. I don’t know the specific number but I am sure that over 20 people were abducted.” The resident added that there is panic in the community, while some residents have relocated. Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna police command, could not be reached when contacted as calls to his line didn’t go through. The attack comes days after 40 people were killed in communities across Giwa LGA over the weekend. Meanwhile, speaking after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, had called for tougher action against banditry, adding that “the only repentant bandit is the one that is dead”.
