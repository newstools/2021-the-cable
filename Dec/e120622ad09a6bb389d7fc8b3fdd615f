Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says President Muhammadu Buhari is a grandfather who should understand that the country is collapsing due to activities of “terrorists”. In a message on Saturday to congratulate Buhari on his 79th birthday, Nathaniel Ikyur, Ortom’s chief press secretary, quoted the governor as saying the insecurity affecting citizens is not what the president promised when he assumed office in 2015. According to the statement, the governor, who said he loves Buhari, urged the president to take urgent action to secure the country before he leaves office. “I join your family, friends, political associates and all Nigerians to congratulate you on the occasion of your 79th birthday,” he said. “To some, the president is a father, to others, grandfather while yet to others, he is a great grandfather who should understand that Nigeria at the moment is collapsing due to the activities of terrorists who have continued to destroy the very foundation of the unity of this country. “Daily, people are slaughtered like animals either on their farms, at home or roasted to death while travelling from one destination to another with video clips showing the faces of the killers. Yet, no one has been arrested. “The roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.” The governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in fear. “The president should not listen to sycophants who may not be telling him the truth that all is well,” he said. “All is not well with Nigeria right now, Mr President. You must therefore take urgent steps now to pull the nation back from the precipice before it is too late.”
