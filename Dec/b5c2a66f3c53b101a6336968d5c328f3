The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is set to re-introduce the code of conduct for Super Eagles and Super Falcons players. A source at the football house in Abuja told TheCable on Friday that the NFF would mandate its legal department to produce a document that would set standards for the players’ conduct while on national assignments without infringing on their rights. The code of conduct had operated in the past but was later abandoned by subsequent administrations. According to the source, however, recent developments in the male and female senior national teams bordering on indiscipline have necessitated the re-introduction of the code. “The code will outline how players’ complaints and grievances are to be addressed and resolved while setting standards for the conduct of players, coaches and officials, especially when on international assignments. It is a global practice which the players are used to it in their clubs and many national teams also have such guidelines in place,” the source said. “All players (both men and women) called for any international competition will be sent the document along with their invitation letters which they will be advised to screen with their lawyers or representatives before honouring the calls. It is meant to enforce discipline and adherence to the rules.”
