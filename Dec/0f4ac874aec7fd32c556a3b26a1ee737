The Lagos government has released the report of the state’s judicial panel on police brutality. On October 19, 2020, as part of recommendations put forward during the #EndSARS protests, the Lagos government inaugurated the judicial panel to investigate petitions on police brutality in the state. On November 15, the panel submitted two reports — one on police brutality cases and another on the Lekki incident investigation. The panel had listed nine fatalities from the shooting at the Lekki tollgate on October 20, 2020. However, a white paper committee set up by the Lagos government, citing what it described as “fundamental inconsistencies,” rejected the figure and said the panel’s findings are not supported by evidence. According to a statement signed by Moyosore Onigbanjo, the state’s attorney-general and commissioner for justice, the panel’s report is now officially available to the public. “For further inquires, members of the public can contact the office of the Hon. Attorney-general & commissioner for justice at info@lagosstatemoj.org,” Onigbanjo said. The panel report can be viewed and downloaded here.
