Oladayo Amao, chief of air staff, has directed troops to “sustain the tempo of operations” until bandits are “completely eliminated”. Edward Gabkwet, NAF spokesperson, in a statement on Tuesday, said Amao gave the directive while celebrating Christmas with the troops of operation Gama Aiki and personnel of 013 quick response force in Minna, the Niger capital. Amao who was represented by Sunday Aneke, deputy director of operations, said activities of bandits and insurgents have threatened the national development goals. He, however, added that collaborations with other security agencies has helped to confront some of the challenges facing the nation. “I must therefore state that I am proud of the efforts of all our officers, airmen and airwomen participating in internal security operations in different parts of the country,” he was quoted as saying. While listing achievements of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), he also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for supporting the armed forces in their efforts to tackle the country’s security agencies. “It is gratifying to note that operational manpower development in the NAF recently received a boost with the winging of 26 new pilots and 31 operators since my assumption of office,” he said. “In the same vein, I am happy to note that we currently have a total of 195 officers, airmen and airwomen undergoing various training courses abroad cutting across several specialties and trades. “In addition, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training at 403 Flying Training School, Kano, while 12 others are undergoing Basic Transport Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna. These courses are aimed at maintaining combat readiness by increasing the number of pilots to man our ever-increasing inventory of aircraft.”
