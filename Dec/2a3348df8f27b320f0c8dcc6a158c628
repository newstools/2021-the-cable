Over 100 players will converge on Lakowe Lakes Golf and Country Club in Lagos this weekend ahead of the 6th edition of the club’s championship. The annual competition, scheduled for December 4 and 5, is the flagship of the country’s most prestigious golf club and is usually graded by golfing categories while the overall winner is judged by the gross score at the end of 36 holes play. Femi Olagbenro, manager of the Lakowe Golf Club, said the course was in its best shape, adding that players who excelled would be adequately rewarded. “The Club Championship is the crowning event of our golfing calendar. Among other things, it attracts the best players and especially new players give their best to upturn the existing playing records in an electric atmosphere,” Olagbenro said. “We pride ourselves on maintenance and participating players always brace up to have the best fairways and greens to play on. We can only hope for a clement weather.” Peter Eben-Spiff, defending champion and one of the few Nigerian amateur players on the world amateur golf ranking, would hope to hold down perennial rivals who include Tunji Adebayo for a trifecta. Other notable players expected are Fatumata Coker (Ladies defending champion), Njide Ndili, Kim Tai Chul (Veteran’s defending champion), Dapo Akande, Ibiyemi Walter, and Vitus Ezenwa. Speaking on Thursday, the organisers said an award dinner would round off the two-day championship. The organisers also added that the event is being supported by Mixta Africa, Mainstream Foundation, Hydropolis, Geregu Powerplant Plc, NNPC/Chevron JV, Interswitch, Sparkle, Gremoore, TotalEnergies, OPAS, and DEL.
