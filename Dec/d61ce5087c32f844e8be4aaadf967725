The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has called for synergy between the government and citizens in fighting corruption. In a statement on Thursday, Idayat Hassan, CDD director, said in commemoration of the international anti-corruption day, the government needs to tighten the noose on persons that are corruptly enriching themselves within the system. She said corruption has attained a national emergency status that requires a collaborative strategy involving the government and  citizens. The CDD further asked Nigerians to exercise their rights to call for accountability and join civil society and the media in saying no to corruption. “The International Anti-corruption Day is a special opportunity for stock-taking,” Hassan said. “While the world has made significant strides in the fight against corruption, particularly with improved beneficial ownership disclosure, international synergies between and among anti-corruption agencies, and asset recovery and repatriation, more need to be done at the domestic level. “Countries such as Nigeria remain entangled in corruption, and with the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic still deepening, the effectiveness of recovery efforts will hinge critically on limiting corruption. For this reason, government officials, civil society actors, media practitioners and citizens must take a bold stand against corruption. “In continuation of its anti-corruption interventions, CDD remains committed to supporting public institutions, particularly anti-corruption agencies with the technical capacity and material tools to improve the performance of their mandate.” The CDD also called on political leaders to intensify efforts in providing the political will, in addition to the legislative support, in the fight against the scourge of corruption in Nigeria.
