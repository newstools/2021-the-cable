The police say 15 suspects arrested for raiding the home of Mary Odili, supreme court justice, will be arraigned on December 15, 2021. Frank Mba, force public relations officer, confirmed to TheCable that the suspects will be brought before Nkeonye Maha, an Abuja federal high court judge, on Wednesday. Mba said: “The arraignment is tomorrow before a federal high court.” On October 29, security operatives invaded the Odili residence in Abuja to enforce a search warrant issued by a magistrate court over the allegation of illegal activities happening at the house. Documents seen by TheCable, however, revealed that the warrant presented by the security operatives bore a wrong address. On November 11, the police paraded 14 persons in connection with the invasion. The police also arrested one Abdullahi Usman, an assistant superintendent of immigration who serves in Nasarawa command. Mba, while parading the suspects, accused them of forging documents that were used in securing a search warrant. Among those arrested are Lawrence Ajodo, said to be a “fake police officer”; Stanley Nkwazema, identified as a journalist, and an Islamic scholar. However, THISDAY newspapers refuted the claim that Nkwazema works for the media organisation. Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, also denied approving the search on the Odili residence. Charges were filed against the suspects on November 24.
