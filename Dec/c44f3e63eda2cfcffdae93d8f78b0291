Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, says Nigeria hopes to have the largest fifth generation (5G) network coverage in Africa by 2022. He said this on Monday in Abuja at the auction of the 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz) spectrum organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). TheCable had reported that the NCC was planning to auction two slots of the 3.5 GHz spectrum. Using the ascending clock auction system for the mock session, the three qualified bidders, namely: MTN Nigeria, Mafab Communications Ltd, and Airtel Networks Ltd, participated in the software-based simulated auction exercise on Friday. Pantami said the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have so far confirmed that the deployment of 5G does not cause any adverse health effects. “These are the two most recognised institutions when it comes to technology and health. With their own verdict and position, that has provided the grounds for all other nations to be proactive in the deployment of 5G,” he explained. “It is because of this and looking at the general benefits of the 5G deployment globally, Nigeria as a country, being the giant of Africa, feels it is necessary for us to kickstart the process of 5G deployment. “Let us not forget that Nigeria has the largest digital economy in Africa, Nigeria has the largest telecommunications market in Africa, Nigeria has the largest internet subscribers in Africa, Nigeria has the largest broadband and we hope that by 2022, Nigeria will have the widest 5G coverage in Africa.” Pantami said the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC) would ensure that the required spectrum for 5G standard was made available in the most timely manner. This, he said, would enable investment, innovation and competition in the development of 5G services for the benefit of consumers and businesses.
