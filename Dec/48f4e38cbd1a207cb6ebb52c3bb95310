The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and northern governors to “show more empathy” towards victims of banditry in the region. In a statement issued on Monday by Emmanuel Yawe, its national publicity secretary, ACF condemned the recent killing of 38 people by bandits in Giwa LGA of Kaduna state. The group urged Buhari, governors and northern leaders to do better and show the people they care. “The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) will like to put on record its total disapproval, frustration and anger against what appears to be an endless orgy killing in northern Nigeria,” the statement reads. “The latest incidence took place in Giwa LGA of Kaduna state where 38 innocent citizens were hacked to death. “According to Samuel Aruwan, the state’s commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, many houses, trucks, cars and food crops were destroyed during the attacks. “While the ACF joins the governor of Kaduna and the President of Nigeria in consoling those who suffered losses during the latest attack, we call on all the state governments and the federal government to show more empathy and sympathy in such grave security breaches. “Nothing stops the President and a State governor from visiting such places. We sadĺy note that he has never felt it necessary to do so. In fact, following his example, not one governor has done so except Governor Zulum of Borno. Just a few days ago, also in Uba-Askira in Borno, where 10 people were killed, and uncountable numbers were taken away. “The President and the northern governors are unwittingly creating the impression that only their lives, those of their immediate family members and their officers matter. “The ACF believes the President and the northern governors have the capacity to do better than this.”
