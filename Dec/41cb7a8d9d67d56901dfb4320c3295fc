The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says it has increased the number of daily trips on the Lagos-Ibadan train service with effect from Monday. The increase will run for three weeks to accommodate the expected upsurge in passenger traffic during the Yuletide season. The corporation said the trains would operate from 8 am on December 20, 2021, to 4 pm on January 9, 2022. Jerry Oche, Lagos district manager of NRC, told NAN on Sunday that the increase in train trips would decongest road traffic. Oche urged passengers to board the trains with a maximum of 12kg luggage. <img class="alignnone wp-image-641675 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-1024x734.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="645" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-1024x734.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-300x215.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-768x550.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-24x17.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-36x26.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail-48x34.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rail.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> TheCable had reported that Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, said the Abuja-Kaduna train service generates at least N300 million every month. He also disclosed that the federal government plans to add 16 more trains to the Lagos-Ibadan rail line to increase revenue generation. “Currently, we are running Lagos-Ibadan from the money we are making from Abuja-Kaduna rail service,” he had said.
