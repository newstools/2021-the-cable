A police officer was shot dead on Thursday when gunmen attacked Eziama Uli community in Ihiala LGA of Anambra state. One other officer was said to have been injured in the attack. The officers were reportedly providing security for a medical outreach when the gunmen attacked the community. Tochukwu Ikenga, police spokesperson in Anambra, confirmed the development on Friday and said an investigation has been launched into the incident. “The details of the incident are still sketchy but it involves police personnel providing security services. Operatives have cordoned off the area, while an investigation is ongoing,’’ he said. In recent months, the south-eastern state has witnessed a surge in the activities of gunmen which have led to the killings of residents, including security operatives. In November, two police officers were killed in the state and their bodies were burnt. A month earlier, three police officers were killed while two others were injured when a security post was attacked by gunmen.
