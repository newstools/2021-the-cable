Gunmen have reportedly abducted Damian Nwaigwe, a traditional ruler in a community in Aboh Mbaise LGA of Imo state. The incident reportedly occurred at Nwaigwe’s palace in the wee hours of Thursday. A resident of the community said it was easy for the gunmen to abduct the traditional ruler because his palace is far away from where other villagers live. “The traditional ruler of Mbutu ancient kingdom in the Aboh Mbaise LGA of Imo state, Eze Damian Nwaigwe, has been kidnapped,” the resident said. “The respected king was kidnapped at his palace around 2.30 am on Thursday. “The palace of the king is excluded. He built his house far from where other villagers live, that was why it was not difficult for him to have been kidnapped without any resistance from his subjects.” Confirming the incident, Michael Abattam, spokesman of the police command in Imo, said efforts are underway to rescue the monarch. “Yes it is confirmed and our command has swung into action to rescue the monarch unhurt and as well apprehend those behind the kidnapping,” Abattam said.
