FairMoney Microfinance Bank says it has disbursed loans worth over N117 billion naira since it started operations four years ago. Laurin Hainy, co-founder and chief executive officer, FairMoney, said this recently at a media engagement held in Lagos. According to Hainy, FairMoney aimed at promoting financial inclusion through its banking, lending and investment services. “Our mission has always been to serve the needs of as many Nigerians as possible,” Hainy said. “Our approach to doing this involves providing millions of Nigerians with loans and capital to meet their immediate needs and in some cases, to grow their businesses, and so far, we have disbursed over 117 Billion loans since inception. “Our goal ultimately is to use technology to bank the 60 million Nigerians currently excluded from the financial ecosystem. “‘We have also introduced secure and innovative technology processes to improve our lending operations, as well as a strong privacy protection policy, and a comprehensive loan collection policy which has been successfully deployed in the last 4 years.” Also, speaking at the media parley, Nengi Akinola, head of marketing and branding, reiterated FairMoney’s commitment to supporting Nigerians. “To us at FairMoney, the goal is to see a world where everyone has equal financial opportunities and support to reach their financial goals, however great or wide it may be,” she said. “We will continue to build on our offerings so that we can continue to meet the growing needs of the average Nigerian customers. “We can’t wait to share all the interesting new features we are bringing to the FairMoney app in the new year.”
