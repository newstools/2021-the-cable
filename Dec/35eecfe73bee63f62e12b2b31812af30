Some residents protesting the death of a seven-year-old girl, who had been declared missing in Adehun area of Ado-Ekiti in Ekiti state, have razed the house of a cleric. The incident occurred on Tuesday and involved a pastor said to be attached to the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in the area. According to NAN, the body of the girl, identified as Demilade, was allegedly found in the pastor’s premises. Demilade was said to have been declared missing around 8am on Monday while on an errand to buy pap. Her parents are said to have raised an alarm when she could not be found, and residents organised a search party. The development was, however, reported to a nearby police station in Adehun area when efforts to locate Demilade proved abortive. Speaking on the development, some sources who preferred not to be named, claimed that the victim’s body was found at the pastor’s house in the neighbourhood. Sunday Abutu, spokesman of the Ekiti police command, confirmed the incident and said a suspect has been arrested in connection with the alleged murder. He, however, did not give details of the identity of the suspect. Abutu, who said the arrest was effected based on the information given by the parents, added that the alleged culprit is in detention at the police headquarters in Ado-Ekiti. “The body of the girl had been recovered and deposited at the morgue,” Abutu said. “The CP had directed that the matter be investigated thoroughly. “We are studying and extracting information from the suspect in our custody and we shall inform the members of the public about our findings when we are through.”
