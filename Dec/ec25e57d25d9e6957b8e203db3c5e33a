Growth Africa Capital, an entrepreneurial initiative, has partnered with Lagos Business School to support 50 startups with training and mentorship opportunities. Samuel Ajiboyede, group managing director, Growth Africa Capital, said this at an event on Thursday in Lagos. Ajiboyede said the organisation seeks to empower people to become billionaire entrepreneurs through training, technology, and reorientation. “The idea is that there are a lot of startups struggling not because they don’t have the right idea or product, but they don’t have the right information or guide. We believe that through this training or initiative that would last for three months, these 50 businesses would be able to do well, become better and help society by creating jobs and reducing frustrations,” Ajiboyede said. “The startups are early business people who are finding it hard to make a profit or not finding the right mentors. This would, in a way, expose them to giants that would give them useful information on how to apply them to their businesses. We will also help them to raise funds.” He added that interested applicants can apply via www.growthafricacapital.net from December 24, 2021. Henrietta Onwuegbuzie, director, MBA programmes at Lagos Business School, said that the partnership with Growth Africa Capital provided an opportunity to impact more businesses and lives, as participants get the best of training and mentorship. “We train people to understand that business is about solving problems and not to make money,” Onwuegbuzie said. “I really appreciate what Growth Africa Capital is doing as it would give room for startups and young people to become better and not have the mentality of becoming job seekers but job creators who are solving problems. “Through this training, people get to know that being successful is about providing for the needs of others through solutions.”
