The Adamawa government says it has banned the professional hunters association of Nigeria from operating in the 21 LGAs in the state. The decision was announced on Monday in a statement by Humwashi Wonosikou, chief press secretary to the governor. According to the statement, Ahmadu Fintiri, governor of Adamawa, said the state had received reports of alleged abuse of power by the hunters. “The Adamawa State Government has banned the operations of the Professional Hunters Association of Nigeria across the 21 Local Government areas of the State, especially in Demsa, Numan, Lamurde, Guyuk and Shelleng,” the statement reads. “This follows reports of abuse of the rules of engagement and lack of regard for the traditional institution and security agencies. “The Governor notes that activities of the Professional Hunters Association was capable of causing public disturbance and henceforth should desist from performing any function under the guise of providing security to the public. “More worrisome is the fact that the association operates independent of any security organisation in the 5 Local Government areas, thereby giving room for suspicion of their motive and intentions especially that they operate in uniforms of our security agencies and at odd hours.” Fintiri added that “no group or anybody will be allowed to take the law into their hands, disrespect security agencies and the traditional institution”. The governor also directed security agencies to ensure that the order is enforced.
