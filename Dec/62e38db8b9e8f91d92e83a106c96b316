The Kaduna police command says its operatives have rescued 48 traders who were abducted by bandits along the Birnin Gwari-Kaduna road. There were reports that the traders, who were said to be travelling in a convoy and escorted by a police team, were abducted on Wednesday after bandits opened fire on them. But in a statement on Thursday, Mohammed Jalige, the state police spokesman, said the victims from Udawa village in Chikun LGA of Kaduna, were rescued by the police. “On the 22nd December, 2021, at about 0930hrs a team of Policemen while on escorting a convoy of traders from Udawa village in Chikun LGA along Birnin Gwari to Kaduna came under heavy gunshots by armed bandits which led to the kidnap of a score of persons,” the statement reads. “However, the escort team reinforced themselves and engaged the bandits in a tactical pursuit in order not to harm the victims. “Thus, the precision of approach exhibited by the Officers forced the bandits to retreat, abandoning their victims and scampered with bloody gunshot wounds.” He, however, said information available to the command indicated that one woman was yet to be accounted for, adding that efforts are being intensified to ensure her safe return. “Additional manpower will be mobilised to the area to safeguard lives and properties of civilian population in the area,” he said. “The Commissioner of Police commended the officers for their resilience in the face of danger while serving their fatherland and tasked them to be adequately equipped and alert while embarking on such duties.”
