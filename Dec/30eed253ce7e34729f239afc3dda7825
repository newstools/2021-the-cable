The gunmen had, over the weekend, attacked Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya villages in Idasu, Giwa LGA. The attackers had destroyed properties, and set ablaze farm produce and vehicles. Giving an update on the incident, Aruwan said the two corpses were found by security operatives during a search operation “Security agencies carrying out search operations in Giwa LGA have reported to the Kaduna state government the discovery of two additional bodies following the weekend’s attack in some villages in the area,” he said. “It would be recalled that Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya villages in Idasu, Giwa LGA were attacked by armed bandits, with 38 people confirmed dead as at yesterday. “The latest discovery of two more bodies brings the death toll from the attack to 40. “Further details will be published as they are confirmed.” President Muhammadu Buhari had, in a statement on Sunday, described the perpetrators as “terrorists” and directed security agencies to “destroy them”.
