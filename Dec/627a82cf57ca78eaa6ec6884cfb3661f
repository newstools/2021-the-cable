President Muhammadu Buhari says insecurity in Nigeria will soon be history. In a Christmas message on Friday, Buhari said though “remarkable successes” have been made in the area of fighting insecurity, there are still some challenges. The president said there is a need for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to fight insecurity together. “On security, despite the remarkable successes generally recorded, we still have some challenges,” he said. “Our courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land. “Recently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region. “I am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.” The president appealed to citizens to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a means of curbing the spread of the infection. “The silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions. I want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic,” he said. “Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.”
