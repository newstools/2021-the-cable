Two persons have been killed following an attack by gunmen on Unguwan Gimbiya community in Chikun LGA of Kaduna state. Twenty-eight persons were also said to have been abducted in the attack that occurred in the early hours of Friday. Muhammad Jalige, police public relations officer in Kaduna, confirmed the attack to the TheCable. “We just came back from the scene. We have spoken with the leaders of the community and they have confirmed to us that the number is 28,” he said. “The commissioner of police has directed that more officers be deployed to the area to comb the nearby bushes to see if we can rescue some of them.” However, a resident of the community said up to 50 people were abducted, adding that the bandits appeared to select the houses that were attacked. “The bandits were many and they went to selected houses. It’s like they were operating based on informant’s information,” the local said. “They operated for over an hour and killed two people and abducted 50 others. One of those killed was slaughtered like a ram. A woman whose husband travelled was abducted alongside her children. “They went to 13 selected houses and took 50 people. There was no help from anywhere and we were at their mercy. They had a field day as nobody could resist them. We are in big trouble.”
