Itunu Babalola, the Nigerian lady who died in prison in Côte D’Ivoire, has been buried in Ibadan, Oyo state. According to Punch, the deceased’s body arrived at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos on Friday at 11pm via Air Côte D’Ivoire and was taken to Oyo. Her remains were laid to rest on Saturday at the Sango Cemetery. Officials of the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) deployed by Abike Dabiri-Erewa, chairman of the commission, were said to have been present at the burial. Babalola got entangled in a legal battle when she reported to the police that her house in Bondoukou, Cote d’Ivoire, had been burgled. She was said to have been charged to court and the prosecutor in collaboration with the police allegedly compromised the case and accused her of human trafficking. Babalola was eventually convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The sentence was later reduced to 10 years. Dabiri-Erewa, at the time, had said NIDCOM was doing all it could to secure the release of Babalola. But on November 15, the 21-year-old Nigerian died in a Cote d’Ivoire prison from diabetic complications — after spending more than two years in incarceration. Reacting to news of her death, the NIDCOM boss said the Nigerian government will ensure that justice is served. She said the ambassador of Nigeria to Cote d’Ivoire has demanded an autopsy, adding that NiDCOM has also written to Interpol seeking an investigation on the matter. Dabiri-Erewa also said the office of the attorney-general is “following the case,” noting that the Nigerian government will not allow it “to go away”.
