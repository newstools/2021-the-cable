The Lagos4Lagos Movement, a splinter group within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, says it is set to take over the state. Members of the group on Saturday voted in favour of defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Former Senate President Bukola Saraki had visited Lagos to meet with the leaders of the aggrieved APC splinter group. Saraki is the chairman of PDP’s national reconciliation committee. The meeting came weeks after delegates of the PDP led by Raymond Dokpesi, former chairman of Daar Communications, had visited the group on November 8. The group is expected to make official the defection of its members to the PDP on December 8. Lagos4Lagos Movement, led by Olajide Adediran, held parallel local government congresses in September. Speaking with NAN on the planned defection, spokesman of the group, Kazeem Bakare said there is no going back. “The die is cast actually because the argument has been that we can’t make any change elsewhere,” he said. “We have exhausted all processes of reconciliation within the APC. Even at that, we are law-abiding. “We have what it takes to win elections and that is why we are taking our leave. “We believe in a few weeks, unfolding events will tell Lagos residents that we are ready to take over the state for the good of Lagos state.”
