Saliu Mustapha, an aspirant vying for the position of national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is not “sitting idly”. In a Christmas message on Friday, Mustapha said Nigerians should always pray for the government as it works to reposition the country. “We should not also forget to pray for the administration as it goes about the duty of repositioning the country after sixteen years of misrule by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),” Dapo Okubanjo, his media aide, quoted him as saying. “While it is true that we have challenges of insecurity in some parts of the country, we should not lose sight of the fact that the President Buhari-led government is not sitting idly. “It has only recently approved a 20 percent increase in the wages of police personnel aside from ensuring that the Nigerian military are highly motivated with some of the most modern hardware in Africa.” The Turaki of Ilorin said citizens should continue to abide by the COVID-19 protocol in order to be safe from the infection. “Coming at a time when the world is witnessing the fourth phase of the coronavirus pandemic, it is my hope that more Nigerians continue to abide by Covid-19 protocols especially as the country recently recorded 4035 cases in one single day,” he said. “So do not hesitate to wear masks and stick to non pharmaceutical measures in public places such as markets, recreational centres and churches. “Today, I rejoice with all Christians on the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ and wish all Nigerians a merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. “I particularly urged Christians, in particular, and Nigerians, in general, to use the period to rededicate themselves to God as well as pray and work for peace and unity.”
