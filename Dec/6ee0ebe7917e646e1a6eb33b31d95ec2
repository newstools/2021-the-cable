President Muhammadu Buhari has sympathised with the United States following the devastating tornadoes ripping across six states since Friday. Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the president on media and publicity, released a statement to this effect on Sunday. Since the swarm of tornadoes hit Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee, over 70 people have died and many properties have been destroyed. US President Joe Biden had described the incident as “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. “The destruction of whole towns, flattening of houses, schools, hospitals, businesses and other social infrastructure on a scale never seen before is deeply saddening,” Buhari said. “Our deepest sympathies go to all those affected, as well as the government and the American people.” Buhari urged Nigerians to join the rest of the world in praying for the deceased and the quick recovery of other victims and their families.
