President Muhammadu Buhari has reappointed May Agbamuche-Mdu as a national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Agbamuche-Mdu had previously served as INEC commissioner from Delta until Buhari appointed Lauretta Onochie, his aide, to take the position in October 2020. Her nomination had sparked outrage over concerns that she is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), but the presidential aide said she resigned her membership of the ruling party in 2019. TheCable found Onochie’s claim to be false, and the senate eventually rejected her nomination in July. While presenting a report, Kabiru Gaya, chairman of the senate INEC committee, said Onochie was disqualified because Agbamuche-Mdu was still serving as the national commissioner from Delta. “In 2016, we confirmed a national commissioner from Delta state, Mrs May Agbamuche-Mdu and confirming Onochie from the same Delta will violate the federal character,” Gaya had said. When Senate President Ahmad Lawan read Buhari’s request for the nomination of a resident electoral commissioner (REC) and some national commissioners on Tuesday, Agbamuche-Mbu was listed as the nominee from Delta.
