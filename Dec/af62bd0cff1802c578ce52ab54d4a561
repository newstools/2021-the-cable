President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated a seaward defence boat (SDB) built by the Nigerian Navy in Lagos. Speaking on Thursday at the naval dockyard in Lagos, Buhari said the new inductions to the fleet would boost the navy’s capability in securing the country’s maritime domain. In a statement, Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, said the SDB, NNS Oji, is the third of its series to be locally built at the Naval Dockyard Limited solely by Navy engineers after the successes of NNS Adoni and NNS Karaduwa, commissioned in 2016 by the president. Buhari further charged all naval personnel to maintain professionalism and ensure good use of the newly-built and recently acquired platforms including NNS LANA, Kano, Ikenne, Aba, Sokoto and Osun. <img class="alignnone wp-image-637863" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="463" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412.jpg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412-300x253.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412-24x20.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412-36x30.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FB_IMG_1639066753412-48x40.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> “We should note that we are in a critical period where our country is faced with a serious decline in our revenue and the security challenges we are facing,” Buhari said. “The present realities, therefore, call for prudent resource management, innovativeness, accountability and careful maintenance. “I wish to reiterate that despite these challenges, our administration is very determined to ensure that the Navy is well supported to achieve its statutory responsibilities. “Let me assure you that the Government will continue to support the ideals of the Nigerian Navy in the performance of its constitutional duties.
