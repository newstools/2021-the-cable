Uche Nwosu, former governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in Imo state, says he was not invited by the police before he was arrested. Nwosu was arrested on Sunday during a church service in Imo. While condemning the arrest, Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, said the arrest of Nwosu, his son-in-law, was “like a kidnap”. According to a statement issued on Monday by Chikezie Nwadike, his spokesperson, Nwosu said he was released on Sunday and did not spend the night in the police custody. “This is to inform the general public, friends and well-wishers, supporters and sympathizers that Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, who was abducted by security agencies while observing church service at St Peter’s Anglican Church Umunwokwe Village Eziama-Obaire Nkwerre LGA, has regained his freedom and released unconditionally. He never spent a night in their custody as every effort was put in place to get him out,” the statement reads. “Recall the ugly incident that took place yesterday, 26th December 2021, at St Peter’s Anglican Church as security operatives swooped him inside the church during the outing service of his mother’s burial and whisked him away amidst sporadic shootings and harassment of the congregation. “I have spoken with him and he extended his greetings to all of us out there. While we await a Police report on the reasons for the abduction and arrest, we call on everyone to remain calm and focused because God is in charge of the whole situation. “Ugwumba Uche Nwosu is a perfect gentleman who has a great deal of respect for constituted authorities and has never for once caught up in civil disobedience. There was never an invitation and if anyone says otherwise, let the person come forth with evidence.”
