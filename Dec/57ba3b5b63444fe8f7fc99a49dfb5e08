The campaign office of Barau Jibrin, a key member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano state, was razed by thugs in the early hours of Thursday. Jibril, a senator representing Kano North senatorial district, belongs to the Kano APC faction loyal to Ibrahim Shekarau, a former governor of the state. The razed building serves as the meeting point of the faction. An eyewitness said armed thugs invaded the building, vandalised it, and proceeded to set it ablaze. The arsonists are alleged to be members of the faction loyal to Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano. It is unclear what triggered the arson but the two factions have been at loggerheads for some time. The crisis of the APC in Kano worsened after parallel congresses were held by both factions on October 18. The Shekarau faction had elected Haruna Danzago as chairman while Ganduje’s camp elected Abdullahi Abbas. An appeal committee set up by the national caretaker committee recognised the faction loyal to Ganduje. The Shekarau faction has since instituted a case in court challenging the decision of the national caretaker committee. The faction also asked the court to nullify the congresses at wards, LGAs, and state levels. Meanwhile, the police have sealed the residence of Barau Jibrin shortly after his campaign office was set ablaze.
