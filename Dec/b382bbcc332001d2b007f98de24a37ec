Femi Falana, human rights lawyer, has called for a coroner’s inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sylvester Oromoni, a 12-year-old student of Dowen College. TheCable had reported the death of Oromoni, who was alleged to have been attacked by “some senior colleagues” for refusing to join a cult group. His death has continued to spark angry reactions on social media, culminating in the shutdown of the school by the Lagos state government. Dowen College, in a statement on Sunday, said the “tragic and unfortunate incident” requires thorough investigation, adding that it is determined to get to the root of the matter. In a letter signed by Taiwo Olawanle, a lawyer in his firm, Falana on Monday asked the chief coroner of the Lagos high court to order an inquest into the death of Oromoni. “We have been briefed by the family of the late Sylvester Oromoni, a student of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos, who died from injuries he allegedly sustained from the beating by his colleagues that wanted him to join their secret cult group,” the letter reads. “Given the needless death of Sylvester Oromoni, we are compelled to request you to use your good offices to cause a coroner’s inquest to be conducted into the cause of death of this young and promising boy. “And make appropriate recommendations pursuant to Section 15 of the Lagos State Coroner’s Law 2007 which provides that an inquest shall hold whenever a coroner is informed that the death of a deceased person within his coroner district is as a result of a death in a violent, unnatural or suspicious situation. “We hereby request Your Lordship to conduct an inquest into the circumstances surrounding this tragic death at Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos State and we are confident that Your Lordship will accede to our request with utmost urgency.”
