United Airlines says it has commenced flight operations from Washington, United States, to Lagos, Nigeria. The new service marks the airline’s return to Nigeria since it left in 2016 over foreign exchange crisis. In a statement, the airline announced that its inaugural flight from Washington arrived in Lagos on Tuesday. It stated that with three weekly flights, United is the “first and only airline serving Washington, D.C. nonstop from Lagos.” “The flight is operated with state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, featuring United’s award-winning United PolarisSM business class cabin and United Premium PlusSM premium economy,” the statement reads. <img class="alignnone wp-image-634510 size-full" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline.png" alt="" width="802" height="529" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline.png 802w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline-300x198.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline-768x507.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/united-irline-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" />  The airline said that a water cannon salute marked the arrival of United flight UA612.
