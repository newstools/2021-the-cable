The ministry of sports has asked the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to commence moves to have the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and FIFA inspectors approve the use of the newly refurbished Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja for big matches, TheCable can report. The moves come a few days after Aron Nigeria Limited, which was contracted by the Dangote Group, handed over the rehabilitated stadium to Dare Sunday, the minister of youth and sports development. The sports ministry also plans to work with the NFF to facilitate the installation of the video assistant refereeing (VAR) technology in the facility. Two new digital scoreboards were handed over to the ministry by Aron Nigeria Limited on Friday. “The Minister has instructed the Department of Facilities to work with the NFF on getting the stadium certified by CAF or even FIFA, if need be,” a ministry source told TheCable on Tuesday. “I can confirm to you that work has commenced on the training pitches while other necessary facilities like the dressing rooms, media centre, referees’ rooms, medical rooms, rest rooms, and VIP lounges are fully functional.” Gianni Infantino, FIFA president, and Patrice Motsepe, CAF president, had visited the Abuja stadium in October, with the pair expressing delights at the facility. The football executives also pledged to ensure that it hosted important games in the near future. Dangote had earmarked $1 million for the renovation of some part of the 60,000 capacity stadium in August 2020.
