Riders seeking e-hailing services will have to pay more on all rides as Bolt introduced an additional 3 percent booking fee. In a service update sent to customers on Wednesday, the company said the booking fee was necessary due to an “increase in operating costs”. With this, for every ride of N3,000, Bolt users will pay an extra fee of N90, including a previous N20 flat rate. Breakdown of Bolt fare for a ride. Starting from December 8 (today), Bolt said the new booking fee will be used to cover operational costs and “allow us to continue improving features.” “At Bolt, we’re committed to making sure Bolt is the most affordable way to move around Nigeria,” the email reads. “However, we also recognise changes in operating costs which can occur as we work to keep you moving around reliably, safely, and affordably. “From December 8th, 2021, we’re introducing a 3% booking fee on all trips. This will be used to cover operational costs and allow us to continue improving features to make Bolt the best way to move around.” Speaking with TheCable on the development, Emmanuel Ogbuchi, a banker, tagged the increase as unnecessary. “The costs are becoming increasingly too expensive that we riders are seeing it as exploitation,” he said. “As an active bolt user, I’d say that this booking fee of 3 percent or whatever is quite unnecessary and should be discarded.” Desmond, a multimedia producer, said Bolt should have consulted or informed customers about the new development. Last year, Bolt and Uber had increased their fares by 10 percent due to overhead costs by driver-partners. In April, Uber and Bolt drivers under the aegis of Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA) called on e-hailing companies to increase their fares to reflect economic realities, especially with the double-digit inflation.
