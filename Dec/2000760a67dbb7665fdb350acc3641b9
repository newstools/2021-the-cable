Buba Marwa, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), says addressing drug trafficking will contribute positively to the fight against insecurity. He said this on Thursday during an advocacy visit to the headquarters of security agencies in Abuja. According to a statement by Femi Babafemi, NDLEA spokesman, Marwa met with Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff; Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff; Awwal Gambo, chief of naval staff, and Oladayo Amao, chief of air staff. While noting that the illicit drug trade is escalating criminal activities in the country, he said his visit was to strengthen collaboration between the NDLEA and security agencies to address terrorism, banditry and kidnapping. “There’s no doubt that illicit drugs fuel and enhance criminalities, hence the need for more collaboration — a partnership that is mutually beneficial — because when the problem of drugs is taken out of the security challenge equation, the military will have less to do in tackling terrorism, banditry and kidnapping,” he said. He advised the military to introduce drug tests for officers, and commended the armed forces for their support to the agency. Marwa also called for more collaboration in the areas of “intelligence sharing, training, logistics and operational backup”.
