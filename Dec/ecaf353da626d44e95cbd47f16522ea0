Tottenham and Liverpool played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at the London stadium on Sunday evening. Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son were on the scoresheet for Tottenham while Diogo Jota and Andrew Robertson scored for Liverpool in the highly entertaining encounter that saw Spurs’ attackers miss a plethora of gilt-edged chances. Robertson was also sent off a few minutes after his goal as Liverpool lost some ground to Manchester City in the EPL title race. Tottenham had not played a competitive match in 14 days due to COVID-19 outbreak at the club, but Antonio Conte’s men looked the sharper side and took an early lead through Kane. The wasteful home side allowed Liverpool a route back in, with Jota’s header restoring parity before Robertson scored a similar goal in the 69th minute. Liverpool now have 41 points from 18 matches, three behind Manchester City, the league leaders. Earlier in the day, Pep Guardiola’s Man City made easy work of Newcastle United with two goals in each half for a 4-0 win at Saint James Park. Chelsea, however, continued their slump with a goalless draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers. It was Chelsea’s consecutive draw and fourth in eight EPL matches. RESULTS
