Edo Cricket League defending champion, the U-17 Cricket Club, used its first action on Saturday to prove to other opponents that its pre-competition rating was not a fluke. Coming from a walkover win in week 1 against UNIBEN Cricket Club and parading mostly the national U-17 players, the team made mincemeat of Crusaders Cricket Club attempt to pluck a win off them. David Abiebhode’s sterling bowling figures of 5 wickets in 2 overs decimated Crusaders’ batting set up, choking them to last for only 8.1 overs with 28 runs. It took 5.5 overs with no loss of wicket to blow out the Crusaders’ dream. In the second match of the day between Dolphins and Invictus, the efforts of the Isesele twins Odion and Akhere along with Agbi Godsent to register a desperate win for the Dolphins proved abortive as Asia Osaro of Invictus’ 3 wickets for 4 runs in seven balls changed the game which Invictus won by 28 runs in 7.1 overs against Dolphins. Dolphins, however, returned on Sunday to take out Integrity Force Cricket Club in 15.3 overs. Akhere had 63 runs while Adjiwanou Courage took four wickets for 6 runs in 4 overs to cage the ravaging form of Integrity’s Vincent Adewoye who had three catches in the encounter. Dolphin won with 45 runs. The last match saw No-Limit blow past Crusaders with 91 runs, leaving their campaign for the league title in tatters. The Edo cricket league is one of the top cricket leagues in north-west Africa region. It features a high percentage of players representing the country at different levels. The current season features eight teams with main and feeder teams for developmental purpose.

Rocks of Abeokuta Cricket Club will also face Government College Ughelli Cricket Club.
