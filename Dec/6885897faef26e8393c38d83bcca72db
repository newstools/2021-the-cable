The management of Arik Air has announced that its local pilots have called off their strike action and resumed work. Adebanji Ola, the company‘s public relations and communications manager, in a statement on Friday, said the airline’s scheduled flights are currently operating optimally. On Tuesday, Arik Air shut down operations of some flights after pilots kicked off industrial action. The company had threatened to sack the pilots, describing the strike action as illegal — without notice in accordance with laws. “We regret any inconvenience our passengers may have suffered as a result of the strike action and assure all of our continued commitment to operate safely,” the statement reads. “We regret any inconvenience our passengers may have suffered as a result of the strike action and assure all of our continued commitment to operate safely.” In September 2020, Aviation unions had also shut down Arik Air operations over alleged non-payment of staff salaries since April 2020, after the airline placed 90 percent of its workforce on compulsory leave.
