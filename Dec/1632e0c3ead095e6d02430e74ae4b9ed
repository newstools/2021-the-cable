Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, says the federal executive council (FEC) is yet to approve the proposed removal of petrol subsidy. In November, Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, had said Nigeria will remove the subsidy on petrol and replace it with N5000 for the “poorest” Nigerians. On Friday, the national executive council (NEC) of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had said the labour union would hold nationwide rallies against the plan by the federal government to remove the petrol subsidy. However, the minister told Thisday on Sunday that the planned protest was needless as the federal executive council (FEC) had not deliberated on the issue or made a decision to that effect. “That’s their NEC decision, but there’s no point overheating the polity as there is neither any FEC discussion nor decision on the fuel subsidy removal or non-removal,” Ngige said. “I wish them the best of the season, merry Christmas, and a happy and prosperous 2022.”
