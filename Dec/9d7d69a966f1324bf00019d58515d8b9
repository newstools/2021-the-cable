Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has advised Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ife, against endorsing aspirants vying for political offices. Obasanjo gave the advice on Saturday at an event organised to honour Nteranya Sanginga, director-general of the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), and his wife, Charlotte, with the chieftaincy title of Aare and Yeye Aare Afurugbin-Ola. The event held at the palace of the ooni in Ile Ife, Osun state. Speaking on the 2023 elections, the former president said as a father to all, politicians will approach the monarch for support, but the best he should do is to “pray for such a person and let him go”. “All the sons and daughters of Yorubaland, no matter where they are or their standpoint, will come to meet you. This is expected because you are the father of all,” Obasanjo said. “Anyone of them who says that he is interested in politics, just pray for him and let them go. Anyone who approaches you and says that he wants to be president or governor, just pray for such a person and let him go. “Don’t direct Yoruba people to support any aspirant, as we don’t all go in the same direction, which is part of our strength in Yorubaland.” Speaking earlier, Adeyeye commended Sanginga, a Congolese, for his contribution to the development of agriculture in Africa. “I’m impressed with your modest achievements as a true son of Africa. You have been doing all within your capacity to ensure food sufficiency in the continent,” NAN quoted him as saying. “All through the years, you have developed a passion for agriculture and the results are feasible everywhere.”
