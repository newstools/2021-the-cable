Charles Mato, the Sum Pyem of Gindri, in Mangu LGA of Plateau, has regained his freedom from kidnappers. Gabriel Ubah, police public relations officer in Plateau, confirmed the development to TheCable on Friday. “He was released this morning unhurt and has reunited with his family,” Ubah told TheCable. The traditional ruler was kidnapped by gunmen from his residence on Sunday. The abductors later demanded the sum of N500 million as ransom before Mato would be freed. Ibrahim Ali, commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), said some persons suspected to be connected to the abduction have been apprehended. It is not clear if the ransom was paid to secure the release of the traditional leader.
