Tunde Elerewe, a high chief in Owo kingdom, Owo LGA of Ondo state, has been shot dead. TheCable understands that Elerewe was killed on Wednesday while returning from where he and other chiefs had gone to settle a dispute following a directive by Ajibade Ogunoye, the Olowo of Owo. A yet-to-be-identified chief was also shot by the gunmen and is currently receiving treatment at a health facility in the town. Meanwhile, some youths have taken to the streets to protest the killing of Elerewe. The youths, who chanted different songs, blocked the road and burned tyres at the First Bank area of Owo. The development comes amid a series of security breaches across the state in recent times. In November, four persons — including a school principal — were abducted along the Auga-Ise road in Akoko East LGA of Ondo state. In October, two children were abducted in Akure, when gunmen stole a car belonging to the victims’ mother and drove away with the kids. Meanwhile, in September, gunmen attacked an 18-passenger commercial bus along the Ido Ani-Ifira-Akoko expressway and abducted the passengers.
