Okpale Ojikpa, a Makurdi-based lawyer, has been arraigned for allegedly using fake documents to freeze accounts of the Nasarawa state government. Ojikpa, who is said to be representing some pensioners under the aegis of Nigeria Union of Pensioners, allegedly filed a notice of appeal and a petition seeking an interlocutory injunction to prevent banks from granting the Nasarawa government access to its accounts. He was arraigned before a chief magistrate court III, sitting in Lafia, Nasarawa state. Egye Aliyu, counsel for Nasarawa, alleged that the accused used fake court judgements to obtain garnishee orders on the accounts of the state government — an offence which contravenes sections 161 and 164 of the Penal Code. The state counsel further alleged that Ojikpa concealed facts when he approached three different courts of the same jurisdiction and obtained three different injunctions to garnish the account of the state government. Aliyu said the freezing of the account caused insecurity, death, and the near-total collapse of public institutions in the state. “The judgment Mr Ojikpa alleged has been determined at the high court of the federal capital territory (FCT), Abuja,” Aliyu said. “The nature of the offence carries a jail term of seven years, and should Ojikpa be released bail, there is a likelihood that he will continue with the threats against the state government.” However, Ucha Ulegede, defendant’s counsel, prayed the court to grant bail to his client to enable him properly review the charges in preparation for his defence. Emmanuel Jatau, the presiding magistrate, admitted Ojikpa to bail in the sum of N1 million and one surety in like sum. The case has been adjourned to January 16, 2022, for continuation.
