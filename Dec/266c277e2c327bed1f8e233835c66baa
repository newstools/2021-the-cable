Wakanow, a travel agency, says it is offering a special package on trips from Lagos to any south-eastern state for N320,000. According to the travel agency, the money covers transportation in a Toyota Hilux vehicle, a driver and two mobile police officers as escort. A return trip also costs the same. In the flyer shared on its Facebook page on Monday, commuters can also pay “N260,000 per day” for transportation within the south-east, and the package includes commuting in a Toyota Hilux vehicle, with a driver and two police officers as escorts. In another package, Wakanow also said a trip from Lagos to the south-east in a 2015 Toyota Prado will cost N185,000, while travel within the south-east will cost N165,000 per day. “Ride home in style with our full homecoming to the East package.
