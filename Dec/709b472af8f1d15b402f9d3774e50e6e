Bose Omolayo has won Nigeria’s second gold medal at the ongoing world para-powerlifting championship in Tbilisi, Georgia. The 32-year-old was in outstanding form as she out-pressed her opponents to win the women’s 79kg category. The Nigerian led the pack from the beginning of the contest, which was held on Thursday, and lifted 135kg in her first attempt. She lifted 139kg in the second attempt before adding 142kg in the third to secure gold. Omolayo then proceeded for the “power lift” and crashed the world record with a sensational 144kg lift. Vera Muratova of Russia took silver while China’s Miayu Han finished with the bronze medal. The Nigerian was elated at her triumph and attributed the brilliance to God. “I feel fine and happy where I’m right now. It wasn’t my power. It’s god’s power. God helped me to carry with, he helped me to get really good, so I thank God,” she said. Her victory is Nigeria’s second gold medal at the championship after Lucy Ejike finished top in the women’s 67kg event on Wednesday. The competition started on November 28 and is expected to end on December 5.
