The Nigerian army says its troops have arrested Godwin Nnamdi, a suspected leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN). Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, confirmed the arrest in a statement on Sunday. He said the “notorious leader” was nabbed in Nkanu East LGA of Enugu during a clearance operation in the area. The army spokesperson said ammunition was also recovered from the IPOB/ESN camp. “Troops of 82 Division Nigerian Army(NA) in conjunction with other security agencies while conducting Exercise GOLDEN DAWN have arrested one Godwin Nnamdi, a  notorious leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) and Eastern Security Network(ESN) in Nkanu East Local Government Area,” the statement reads. “The  IPOB leader was arrested during joint clearance operations at a camp suspected to be the fortress of IPOB/ESN elements located at Akpowfu Forest in Nkanu East Local Government Area of Enugu State, on Saturday 25 December 2021. “During the clearance operation, troops engaged the dissidents in a firefight compelling them to take to their heels, leading to the arrest of their leader. “Troops recovered various items including one AK 47 rifle, one magazine containing 21 rounds of 7. 62 mm Special,  one handset amongst others. “The Chief of Army Staff(COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya while commending troops for the successes recorded thus far, charged them to comb and clear all suspected hideouts of criminal elements in their Area of Responsibility.” In November, some houses were set ablaze when soldiers invaded Imama, Mgbowo in Agwu LGA of the state. The soldiers were said to have been after a suspect known as Chocho who is believed to be a leader of the ESN, the militant arm of the proscribed IPOB. Earlier in April, the army said it had killed the deputy commander of the group identified as Ikonson.
