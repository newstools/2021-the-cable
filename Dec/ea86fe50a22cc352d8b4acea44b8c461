Lucy Ejike has won Nigeria’s first gold medal in the women’s 67kg event at the ongoing world para-powerlifting championship in Tbilisi, Georgia. The 44-year-old out-lifted her opponent in the competition, which was held on Wednesday, to secure her third world championship gold. The Nigerian was pronounced the winner after China’s Yujiao Tan failed to lift her final attempt. Tan settled for silver while Egypt’s Fatma Omar took bronze for lifting 122kg in her final attempt. Ejike was elated to have returned to the top of her weight category after a relatively disappointing outing at the Tokyo Paralympic earlier this year, where she took bronze.
