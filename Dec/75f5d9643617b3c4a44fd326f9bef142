Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his 79th birthday. In a statement on Friday, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi state, described the president as a “selfless leader” and a “role model”. Bagudu said the APC governors are confident that under Buhari’s leadership, the country “will continue to triumph over our challenges”. “The Progressive Governors Forum joins His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and his family to celebrate his 79th birthday,” the governor said. “Together with all Nigerians, we celebrate this special day with you and your family. We acknowledge and commend your leadership, vision and commitment to a united prosperous Nigeria. In the last few years, the world has been challenged further to nation-specific issues. “We are confident that under your leadership, we shall continue to triumph over our challenges while progressing to a stronger, prosperous and more peaceful nation. “As we wish you a happy birthday and also say a big thank you for your selfless service to our dear country, we reaffirm our commitment to work under your leadership with the abiding faith and belief that the initiatives of our APC Federal Government will meet all the expectations of Nigerians. “We are very proud of your patriotic leadership. You are our role model and a source of inspiration.” The governors also congratulated Abubakar Sani Bello, governor of Niger state, on his 54th birthday. The governors said Bello “symbolises the success” of the APC. “We in particular wish to acknowledge and commend your leadership, vision and commitment to a united prosperous Nigeria, under the leadership of our party, APC,” they said.
