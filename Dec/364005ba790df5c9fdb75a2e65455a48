The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) says it plans to set up a special security team to strengthen the security around custodial centres across the country. Haliru Nababa, controller-general of NCoS, spoke after a meeting with Abubakar Audi, the commandant general of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and Idris Jere, acting comptroller-general of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS). He said Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, had during the ministerial retreat held on December 9, directed security agencies under the ministry to work together as a family in the area of intelligence gathering, sharing and physical confrontation with jail attackers. He described the perpetrators as common enemies whose main agenda was to challenge the authority and test the might of the federal government. He said the synergy would also include the immediate inauguration of a joint task force of armed personnel comprising the three arm-bearing agencies under the ministry of interior. He also said the task force is expected to combine with the armed forces and the police force that are already deployed to support the armed squad in guarding custodial centres. Responding, Audi lauded the initiative and promised to direct all state commandants of his service to gear up for the task. He also called for regular meetings and more investment in intelligence gathering that will help forestall armed invasions. There has been a series of jailbreaks at different custodial centres across the country in recent months, which has led to the loss of lives and the escaping of thousands of inmates. The most recent attack occurred in November when gunmen invaded the Jos correctional centre.
