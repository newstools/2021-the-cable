An Edo-based iron welder, Osaze Osemwegie, and Lagos-based export trader, Afeez Oseni, expressed exuberant joy as they showered gratitude on telecommunications service provider, Globacom, for the brand new Kia Rio cars they each won in the ongoing customer appreciation promo, Joy Unlimited Extravaganza. While Osaze’s car prize was presented to him at an impressive ceremony at Gloworld, Mission Road , Benin, on Tuesday, Oseni received his own Kia Rio at the Gloworld shop, Allen Avenue, Ikeja, the same day. Both 45-year-old Osemwegie and his wife, Blessing, expressed profound gratitude to Globacom. He said, “I never thought I could drive a brand new car this year. I am a welder. There is no way I would have been able to afford the car but God has used Glo to fulfil one of my life ambitions. Thank you Glo”. On his part, 38-year-old Oseni said, “I did not believe it. I was called by Glo customer care that I won a car in the Glo promo and it was not until the car was presented to me a few minutes ago that I believed it was real. Glo has blessed me, a clearing agent of imported used cars with a brand new car, which happens to be my first car. It is indeed a big surprise. To God be the glory”. <img class="alignnone wp-image-640000" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joy-Benin-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-639999" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="365" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993-300x199.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993-768x510.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC_0993-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Apart from the cars winners, about 50 lucky subscribers won expensive home appliances including fridges, power generators and television sets in Benin while Lagos recorded 64 winners.
