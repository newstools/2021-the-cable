Cable News Network (CNN) has fired Chris Cuomo for helping his brother, Andrew Cuomo, deal with sexual harassment allegations. Andrew Cuomo was forced to step down as New York governor in August 2021 as a result of the scandal. A criminal complaint charging him with a misdemeanor sex offense was filed two months later. Chris Cuomo was initially suspended by CNN after his efforts to help his brother were revealed through documents released by Letitia James, New York attorney-general. The documents showed that the anchor tried to use his connections in the media to help his brother deal with the allegations. In a statement on Saturday, CNN said it decided to fire Cuomo after “additional information” came to light. “Chris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother’s defense,” the statement reads. “We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately.” In May, Cuomo admitted that he had broken some of CNN’s rules in advising his brother on how to handle the allegations from a public relations perspective. Reacting to his termination, Cuomo said: “This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. “So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN’s #1 show in the most competitive time slot. I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work.”
