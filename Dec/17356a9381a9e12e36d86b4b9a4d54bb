Bamidele Faparusi, Ekiti commissioner for infrastructure and public utilities, has resigned. According to NAN, Faparusi conveyed his resignation to Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor, in a letter dated December 14. He is the second appointee to resign from the Ekiti government in the past two weeks — on December 7, Biodun Oyebanji, secretary to the Ekiti state government, resigned from his position. Fayemi had given appointees interested in contesting in the forthcoming governorship election a deadline of December 18 to submit their resignation letters. In the letter, Faparusi thanked the governor for the opportunity to serve in his administration. “It enabled me to serve as the political head of the ministry of infrastructure and public utilities, which is pivotal to the development agenda of this administration,” he said. “Under your proactive leadership, I had the rare opportunity to consolidate on my cognate experience, broaden my perspective and build capacities in the service to the people. “These are the bases of my decision to vie for the governorship seat following extensive consultations with the people and critical stakeholders. “I wish to convey my decision to resign from the government to enable me to focus on the intense work required to make our party walk to victory at the polls. “I am most grateful to you and particularly take this opportunity to thank you for the assurances of your unalloyed support. “I once again reaffirm my loyalty to you and my commitment to the progress of our great party and Ekiti state.”
