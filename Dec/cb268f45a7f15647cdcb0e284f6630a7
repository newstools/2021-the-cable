You may have come across the poster of a movie on the internet titled “The Omicron Variant” and allegedly released in 1963. The poster suggests a science fiction movie with the inscription “The Day The Earth Was Turned Into A Cemetery!”. The plot is said to tell the story of an alien who takes over the body of a human so it can learn more information about the earth, making it easier for his race to eventually invade the planet.<img class="alignleft wp-image-635773 size-medium" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-211x300.jpeg" alt="" width="211" height="300" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-722x1024.jpeg 722w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-17x24.jpeg 17w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-25x36.jpeg 25w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron-34x48.jpeg 34w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fake-omicron.jpeg 761w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /> The poster has been widely shared on social media following the announcement of a new COVID-19 variant called “Omicron”. Those who shared the movie poster have drawn a comparison between the film allegedly released in 1963 and the new COVID-19 variant. This has spread some conspiracy theories online. On Wednesday, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced the detection of the Omicron COVID-19 variant in Nigeria. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has designated the Omicron variant of COVID as a “variant of concern”. A social media user wrote, “This science fiction movie was first realised in 1963. 58 years later, here comes the real disease caused by the “Omicron’ variant of covid 19. coincidence ??” This science fiction movie was first realised in 1963. 58 years later, here comes the real disease caused by the "Omicron'  variant of covid 19. coincidence ?? pic.twitter.com/LyT89l9nfB — The 36.47 g/mol in HCL (@_Hydrochloric) December 2, 2021  What are the odds … this movie released in 1963! #OmicronVariant pic.twitter.com/Ny2Z6l5awJ — Gautam Rode (@gautam_rode) December 2, 2021  Fictional movie"The Omicron variant" becomes true.

There is actually an Italian satirical comedy movie called “Omicron”, which was released in 1963, but it was never about the COVID-19 pandemic. The poster of the “Omicron variant” movie was altered. On November 28, Becky Cheatle, who photoshopped the viral movie poster, made a post to clarify the doctored image. “Hi. It’s been brought to my attention that one of my posters is circulating on Spanish language Twitter as ‘proof’ of a Covid hoax. It’s just a goof because I thought Omicron Variant sounded like a 70s sci-fi movie. Please do not get sick on account of my dumb joke. Thanks,” she said. I Photoshopped the phrase "The Omicron Variant" into a bunch of 70s sci-fi movie posters #Omicron pic.twitter.com/1BuSL4mYwl — Becky Cheatle (@BeckyCheatle) November 28, 2021  VERDICT: The COVID variant movie poster is fake.
