Max Verstappen has clinched his first Formula 1 (F1) world championship after finishing ahead of Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The Dutch had to fight his way from behind to snatch the championship from Hamilton in a nerve-racking race at the Yas Marina Circuit on Sunday. The duo came into the final race of the season tied on 369.5 points which gave the showdown its nail-biting edge. The 24-year-old’s victory denies Hamilton a chance to clinch his eighth world championship and become the most successful F1 driver ever. Hamilton dominated the race expertly from the earliest laps as Verstappen followed him closely all through the race. The Dutch’s break came in the final lap after a slip on the path of the British allowed him nosed ahead and he cruised into victory in the most dramatic style. Verstappen, son of a former F1 driver, made his F1 debut in 2015 and finished 5th in 2016, and followed that up with 3rd place finishes in the 2019 and 2020 championship. He broke out this season where he’s now tied for 1st place with Hamilton, taking the championship till the last race of the season.
