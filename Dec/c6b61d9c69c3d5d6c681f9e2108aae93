The Katsina command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says its operatives have arrested four persons for allegedly attempting to break into a secondary school in Dumukur, Maiadua LGA of the state. Muhammad Abdara, spokesperson of the command, said this on Friday while parading the suspects at the NSCDC headquarters in Katsina. Abdara said the suspects are aged between 18 and 20, and are from Daura town. The NSCDC spokesman added that the suspects were arrested on Thursday by NSCDC operatives stationed at the school to provide security. “The suspected thugs attempted to break into Adamu Danbaffale Model Secondary School, Dumukur Maiadua LGA, Katsina state,” he said. “The officers gallantly subdued the assailants who initially attempted to criminally trespass into the premises of the school (albeit unsuccessfully), while brandishing dangerous weapons. “They also attacked one of our operatives with a machete in an effort to disarm him and subsequently to break into the school. “The culprits have been transferred to the command’s headquarters for further investigation and prosecution.” According to NAN, Abdara also said the general public had important roles to play by assisting security agencies with credible information that could lead to the arrest of criminals. He assured Katsina residents of NSCDC’s readiness to protect schools across the 34 council areas of the state from attacks. “The commandant is warning the criminals to stay off our schools and other private and public property, as we will not relent in our efforts to protect the lives and property of people of the state,” he said.
