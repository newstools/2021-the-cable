The Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria’s total public debt hit N38.005 trillion at the end of the third quarter (Q3) of 2021. It includes the total external and domestic debts of the federal government, 36 state governments, and the federal capital territory (FCT). The debt figure represents an increase of N2.54 trillion within three months compared to the N35.46 trillion recorded at the end of June 2021. In a statement on Tuesday, DMO attributed the increase to the $4 billion eurobonds issued by the federal government in September. The agency said the issuance of $4 billion eurobonds helped to increase the level of the country’s external reserves. “In line with its practice, the Debt Management Office has published Nigeria’s Total Public Debt as at September 30, 2021. The Data, which includes the Total External and Domestic Debts of the Federal Government of Nigeria, thirty-six State Governments, and the Federal Capital Territory, shows that Nigeria’s Public Debt was N38.005tn or $92.626bn at the end of Q3 2021,” the statement reads. “The increase of N2.540tn when compared to the corresponding figure of N35.465 trillion at the end of Q2 2021 was largely accounted for by the $4bn Eurobonds issued by the Government in September 2021.” “The issuance of the USD4 billion Eurobonds has brought significant benefits to the economy by increasing the level of Nigeria’s External Reserves, thereby supporting the Naira Exchange Rate and providing the necessary capital to enable the Federal Government finance various projects in the Budget. “The triple tranche $4bn Eurobond, issued in September 2021, was for the implementation of the New External Borrowing of $6.18bn in the 2021 Appropriation Act.”
