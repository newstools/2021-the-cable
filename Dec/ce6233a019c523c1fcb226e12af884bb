The reasons why President Muhammadu Buhari declined assent to the electoral act amendment bill dominated the cover pages of Nigerian newspapers. The Punch reports that Buhari has returned the electoral bill to the national assembly over the adoption of direct primary in the bill. Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, said passport applicants patronise touts to get faster services, the newspaper says. Daily Independent reports that the court has nullified the participation of Andy Uba, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the Anambra governorship election. Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says the national assembly lacks the courage to override Buhari’s veto on the electoral bill, the newspaper says. The Nigerian Tribune says Buhari has succumbed to the wishes of APC governors by declining assent to the electoral bill. The newspaper reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) needs N305 billion to conduct 2023 elections. Daily Sun says protesters stormed the APC national secretariat to insist on the February date for convention. The newspaper reports that the Arewa Consultative Forum has criticised Buhari and northern governors for “lack of empathy” for victims of banditry. The Nation reports that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has resolved to put on hold its strike. The newspaper says the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that deaths from Omicron COVID-19 variant may likely increase during yuletide.
