Aminu Masari, governor of Katsina, says the periodic rotation of power from one region to another will help to make the country’s federalism stronger. Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, there has been clamour for a power shift to the southern part of the country. Speaking at a media parley in Katsina on Tuesday, Masari said although the constitution does not provide for the mandatory shift of power to any region, such rotation will help the country’s current political structure. “Let me make my position very clear. This constitution is made for us, and not that we are made for the constitution,” the governor said. “The constitution does not say we must shift power, but if you shift, have you violated any part of the constitution? “From my personal opinion as Aminu Bello Masari, until such a time when we have stable polity, I think rotation or shifting power from time to time will help consolidate our federalism.” The governor also said the transition committee in 1999 suggested that each geo-political zone be given an opportunity of five years to rule the country but the provision did not make it to the constitution. Speaking on the failure to conduct LGA elections in his state, Masari blamed the opposition parties. “The opposition knew from day one that they have been trying to sabotage the election and one good way to do that is through litigation,” he said. “We have been to the state’s high court, the federal high court and up to the supreme court not once, and not twice He, however, said there are plans to conduct the poll in the new year, adding that “more than 70 percent of what is required for the election is on ground”.
