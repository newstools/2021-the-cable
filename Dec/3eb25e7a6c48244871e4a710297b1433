Suspects arrested over the invasion of the home of Mary Odili, supreme court justice, have been brought before a federal high court for arraignment. The suspects were brought to court by officers of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) at about 1:45pm. They are to be arraigned before Nkeonye Maha, the presiding judge, on an 18-count charge. On October 29, security operatives invaded the Odili residence in Abuja to enforce a search warrant issued by a magistrate court over the allegation of illegal activities happening at the house. Documents seen by TheCable, however, revealed that the warrant presented by the security operatives bore a wrong address. On November 11, the police paraded 14 persons arrested in connection with the invasion. The police also arrested one Abdullahi Usman, an assistant superintendent of immigration, who serves in the Nasarawa command. Frank Mba, police spokesperson, while parading the suspects, accused them of forging documents that were used in securing the search warrant. Among those arrested are Lawrence Ajodo, said to be a “fake police officer”; Stanley Nkwazema, identified as a journalist, and an Islamic scholar. However, THISDAY newspapers refuted the claim that Nkwazema works for the media organisation. Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, also denied approving the search on the Odili residence. Charges were filed against the suspects on November 24.
