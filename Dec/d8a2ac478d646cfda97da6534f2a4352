Maxwell Odum, chief executive officer (CEO) of MBA Trading and Capital Investment, has been declared wanted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged N213 billion fraud. The development comes months after some persons who claimed to be victims of the alleged fraud protested at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja. In a notice issued on its website and signed by Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, the anti-graft agency is accusing Odum of “conspiracy, obtaining money by false pretence and money laundering to the
tune of N213 billion”. “Odum is a native of lkwerre in Obio-Akpor local government area, Rivers state,” the notice reads. “His last known address is at 7, Odum Street Elekahia, Port Harcourt, Rivers state. “Anybody with useful information as to his whereabouts should please contact
the commission in its Benin, Kaduna, Ibadan, Sokoto, Gombe, Maiduguri,
Makurdi, Ilorin, Enugu, Kano, Lagos, Gombe, Port Harcourt and Abuja offices or through these numbers 09-9044751-3, 08o93322644, 08183322644, 070-26350721-3, 070-6350724-5, its e-mail address: info@efcenigeria.org or the
nearest police station and other security agencies.” In recent years, Nigerians have been victims of various schemes of alleged fraud, ranging from MMM to Loom. In April, Hamzat Bashar, a resident of Sokoto, was sentenced to 70 years in prison for defrauding several persons of a total of N29,865,000 in an “investment scheme”. In another development, the EFCC, in May, arrested one Amos Omotade-Sparks, identified as the operator of ‘Inks Nation’, for allegedly defrauding people to the tune of N32 million.
