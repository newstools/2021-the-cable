Jose Peseiro has been appointed as the new head coach of the Super Eagles. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) announced Peseiro’s appointment in a communique on Wednesday evening. The Portuguese tactician replaces Gernot Rohr, the Franco-German, who was sacked on December 12. Peseiro is expected to be at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) as an observer, while Augustine Eguavoen, the former international, will be in the dug-out when the three-time African champions file out at the tournament next month in Cameroon. “After careful consideration of a memo presented by Chairman of the Technical and Development Sub-Committee, the Executive Committee endorsed a proposal for the appointment of Mr Jose Peseiro as the new Head Coach of the Super Eagles, following the end to the relationship with Mr Gernot Rohr,” the NFF communique read. “However, the Committee resolved that Mr Augustine Eguavoen, named the interim Head Coach, will lead the Super Eagles to the AFCON 2021 in Cameroon with Mr Peseiro only playing the role of Observer. “It was unanimously agreed that the AFCON is a good avenue for Mr Peseiro to launch a working relationship with Mr Eguavoen, who will revert to his role as Technical Director (hence Mr Peseiro’s immediate boss) after the AFCON.” The 61-year-old former Uniao Santarem’s player first assignment will be at the 2022 FIFA World Cup final playoffs in March. The former Portuguese forward took Sporting CP to the UEFA Cup final in 2005. Until his appoint as the Nigerian senior national team coach, Peseiro was Venezuela’s gaffer.
