The senate is currently screening Muazu Sambo, President Muhammadu Buhari’s nominee, for the post of minister of power. Last week, Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm Sambo as the minister of power. If confirmed by the senate, Sambo, who hails from Taraba state, will replace Sale Mamman, former minister of power, whom Buhari sacked in September. Mamman was sacked alongside Sabo Nanono, former agriculture minister. The nominee was accompanied to the red chamber by members of his family and associates. At the commencement of the exercise on Tuesday, Senate President Ahmad Lawan asked the nominee to present himself after which questions from the senators would follow. “This process is a very easy one. You will present yourself. We have your CV but you will be allowed to present yourself; you can add to it (CV). Thereafter, senators will ask questions,” Lawan said. “We hope the senate finds you fit and proper for the nomination.” The exercise is currently underway.
