Wadata Bodinga, head of the directorate of the road traffic services of the federal capital territory (FCT), says the agency has destroyed over 1,400 confiscated motorcycles. Speaking during the crushing exercise on Thursday, Bodinga said the motorcycles were seized from commercial operators between January and June. According to NAN, the FCT director said there are ongoing court processes involving 600 more motorcycles which would be destroyed after they are forfeited. “We have begun the crushing of seized motorcycles that have been duly forfeited by the court of law,” he said. “There are about 1,500 of them crushed as there are about 600 motorcycles that are undergoing the process of forfeiture. We would also follow the same procedure with these ones. “We believe this would serve as a deterrent to people who have refused to follow the rules guiding the operation of motorcycles in the FCT.” Speaking during the exercise, Babaji Sunday, FCT commissioner of police, alleged that the motorcycles are used by individuals to perpetrate crime in the city. “These motorcycles are being used to commit most of the crimes, especially kidnapping and banditry, even within the city centre. They always use these motorcycles as getaway and that is why we are crushing them,” he said. “This would help reduce the crime rate seriously. “When they are caught, they would be made to face the law and their motorcycles would be crushed.”
