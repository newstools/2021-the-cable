One person has died of complications arising from the Omicron COVID-19 variant in the UK. Omicron is said to be highly contagious, though some patients are reporting mild symptoms. According to the BBC, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, announced the death on Monday. Johnson was reported to have said the new variant was also resulting in hospital admissions and the “best thing” people could do was get their booster jab. To check the spread of the variant, the UK had imposed travel restrictions on countries in Africa with reported cases of the new variant — Nigeria inclusive. Daily Mail reported that the UK was mulling lifting the travel bans and replacing them with mandatory tests for the fully vaccinated. The World Health Organisation described Omicron as a variant of concern and advised global leaders to take measures to curb its spread. Nigeria has reported six cases of the variant so far — but yet to report any fatality from the infection.
