The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says there was no explosion at Maiduguri airport in Borno state. TheCable had reported that multiple explosions rocked some communities in the state in the early hours of Saturday. A residential estate in Maiduguri and Ngomari Airport, another community in the state capital, were hit by mortar bombs launched by suspected Boko Haram insurgents. A victim told TheCable that members of his family sustained injuries as a result of the attack. So far, there has been no record of any casualty from the incident. Reacting, Henrietta Yakubu, general manager, corporate affairs of FAAN, said the Maiduguri airport was not affected. “With respect to an online report making the rounds that the Maiduguri airport was rocked by a bomb explosion purportedly masterminded by Boko Haram insurgents, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) hereby notify passengers and the general public that there was neither explosion nor intrusion at the Maiduguri airport,” the statement reads. “The airport was not targeted, and is not under any attack whatsoever”. Yakubu assured air travellers that FAAN remains committed to its core values of safety, security and comfort.
