The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) reconciliation committee inaugurated by Sunday Dare, the sports minister, in Abuja on November 4, has submitted its report. The reconciliation committee was mandated to make recommendations that would resolve the disputes in Nigerian basketball and chart the way forward for the sport. Seyilayo Ojo, chairman of the committee, while submitting the report to the minister, said his team was guided by “selflessness, patriotism, integrity, and national interest in its deliberations”. “All the committee members conducted themselves with maturity and a deep understanding of the issues militating against the growth of basketball in Nigeria. We also made wide consultations with the different interest groups and factions in the bid to get to the root of the crises, some of which have lingered for years,” Ojo said. The committee chairman expressed gratitude to the sports minister for the opportunity to serve Nigeria as well as the adequate support granted to the committee by the ministry. The sports minister also thanked the committee for its efforts and pledged his commitment to studying its recommendations with a view to adopting them on moving Nigeria basketball to great heights. The NBBF reconciliatory committee also had Abba Yola as vice chairman and Toyin Aluko as secretary. Other members were Babs Ogunade, Mukhtar Khaleel, Ikeddy Isiguzo, and Niyi Alebiosu. The NBBF had been in the public eye in October after D’Tigress threatened to boycott all national call-ups over unpaid allowances. On October 25, the sports ministry had waded into the NBBF crisis and issued a directive on the indefinite suspension of the NBBF’s elective congress earlier scheduled for October 30. The ministry also ordered the immediate dissolution of the NBBF caretaker committee headed by Musa Kida ahead of the federation’s elections.
