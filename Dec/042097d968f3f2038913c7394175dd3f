Ibrahim Jubril, one of the parents whose children were found dead in an abandoned car in Lagos, says nobody knows how they got into the vehicle. TheCable had reported that eight children were found dead in a Honda Pilot parked on Adelayo street, Jah-Michael, along Badagry expressway in Lagos, on Saturday. The children were said to be between the ages of four and six. On Sunday, Hakeem Odumosu, commissioner of police in Lagos, ordered a “thorough and speedy” investigation into the circumstances surrounding their death. Speaking with NAN, Jubril, who lost four children — two boys and two girls — said nobody knows how the children got locked inside the car. The bereaved said he was inside a mosque when he was called to come and see what had happened to the children. “I was inside this central mosque when people came to call me to come and see what happened to my children,” he said. “Before I got to the scene, they had brought them out of the car. Nobody knows how they got inside the motor and locked themselves inside. “As a Muslim, everything that happens in life comes from Allah, we believe that it is Allah that gives and take back at any time in life. My wife has also submitted to the will of Allah. “We have buried our children according to Muslim rites and we are here at the mosque praying to Allah to forgive them their sins.” Also, Isiaka Abdul-Wahab, who lost three children in the incident, said he has submitted to the will of Allah. “My two boys, Abdul-Wahab and Yakubu, then a girl, Zainab, just returned from Quranic school. After eating, they started playing with their friends,” he said. “I went to the mosque to pray for about an hour and from there I went to Quranic school to see a friend. “Suddenly, my wife sent for me. When I got there, I saw the lifeless bodies of my children. “We have submitted to the will of Allah because he is the one who gives and takes.”
