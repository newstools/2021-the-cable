They were taken away and never seen again,” the source was quoted as saying. “Even if your family member dies during the mourning period, you are not allowed to cry out loud and the body must be taken out after it’s over. People cannot even celebrate their own birthdays if they fall within the mourning period. Kim Jong II ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011. He was then succeeded by Kim Jong Un, his third and youngest son, who is the current leader.
