The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), City of David Parish, has launched an online dating platform for Christian singles. Idowu Iluyomade, pastor of the parish, disclosed this on Thursday while speaking at a forum in Lagos. Iluyomade said the platform will enable singles to interact and find their life partners. “Redeemers Connect is exclusively for Christian singles, widows, widowers and unmarried seniors in the RCCG global family with serious intent to get married within a year or two upon enlisting as a member,” the website stated. “Our ‘connect to court’ matchmaking algorithm has been carefully designed to take your preferences into account. We encourage honest and genuine responses so that we can match your preferences in the most accurate manner. “We are committed to keeping your profile safe and ensuring that members registered on the site are genuine and active within the church community.” Before posting personal information, prospective members must first read the platform’s terms and conditions. A disclaimer was also put on the site stating that “every registrant must conduct his or her own independent background check before connecting with another registrant on this platform”. “The Redeemed Christian Church of God, City of David Parish makes no representations or warranties and expressly disclaims any and all liability concerning any damages sustained by any registrant as a result of connecting with anyone on this platform,” the parish added.
