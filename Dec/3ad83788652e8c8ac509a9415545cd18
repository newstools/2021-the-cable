Victor Osimhen has made a surprising return to training for the first time since he picked up a nasty face injury last month. The 22-year-old announced his return in a series of posts on his official Twitter account on Wednesday. The Napoli striker was expected to be out of action for three months after he suffered multiple facial fractures from a nasty clash of heads with Inter Milan’s Skriniar in their Serie A encounter on November 21. Osimhen was forced off in the 52nd minute with a side of his face swollen from the impact. Napoli had also announced that the Nigerian would be out of action until the end of February. The development meant Osimhen would not be part of the Super Eagles side travelling to Cameroon for the 2022 AFCON billed for January 9 till February 6. But in a surprising twist, the striker returned to training after just three weeks from the announcement. In the thread of tweets accompanied by a couple of pictures of himself at the training ground, Osimhen thanked those who reached out to him when he was injured. He also appreciated the effort of Gianpaolo Tartaro, the surgeon who operated on him, and other medical staff of the club. “Thankful to god. I sincerely appreciate those who reached out to me. God bless you and yours. No time to dwell on past transgressions. Looking forward to the greater things ahead. God is the greatest. We move, Napoli,” he wrote. “Special mention to the medical staffs of Napoli and Gianpaolo Tartaro (the surgeon). God bless y’all.” At his current pace of recovery, the lanky striker might get back in shape quickly enough to be included in the squad to represent Nigeria at AFCON in Cameroon.
