The office of the senior special assistant to the president on sustainable development goals (OOSAP-SDGs) has entered into a partnership with The August Project (TAP) to empower youths. The project aims to achieve the United Nations mandate on SDGs four, eight and nine (quality education, decent work and economic growth). The 10-year programme is aimed at improving the lives of Nigerian youths by addressing the problems of forced labour, modern day slavery, irregular migration/human trafficking and brain drain in the country. Speaking at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp in Ogun state, Abdulsalami Ladigbolu, global director of TAP, said the programme is targeted at youths, irrespective of their educational qualifications. “The essence of the programme is to complement the priority and aspiration of the country, most especially the effort of President Muhammadu Buhari’s economy recovery and growth plan, towards lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty through sustainable economic growth,” the director said. “The duration of the programme is 10 years and it is targeted at both youths who have higher education qualifications and non-higher education qualifications in Nigeria. “We are working closely with the office of the senior special assistant on SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs) towards helping 1.2 million Nigerians youths to benefit from the programme, so that they can become a relevant global workforce with external validation credentials, so they can compete favorably with their counterparts across the globe. “The programme is targeted at the youths because we believe that the prosperity of any nation will determine how you treat the youths, and giving them an opportunity will play an important role in complementing the efforts of the president in uplifting 100 million youths from poverty.” On her part, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, SAP-SDGs, said the federal government will continue to encourage youths to develop sustainable livelihoods.
