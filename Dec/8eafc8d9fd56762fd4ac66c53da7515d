…set to assemble four models in Nigeria Nigeria’s auto industry recorded a boost in the third quarter of 2021 as MG Motor appointed Stallion Group as the nation’s exclusive distributor for its iconic automobile brand of British origin. Anurag Shah, Nigeria’s General Manager for the brand, who made the disclosure in a media statement, said plans were already on top gear to assemble, distribute, sell and service certain MG models in the country. He said: “Stallion’s push for the MG Motor franchise was motivated by the company’s 25 years experience as the nation’s leading quality automobile sales and service provider, with clear understanding of Nigerian’s taste for quality vehicles. “Moreover, as the disposable income of auto buyers dwindle due to the COVID-induced global economic recession, we understand that businesses and individuals require automobiles that combine durability with affordability, which is what MG and Stallion are reputed for.” Shah also revealed that MG models already lined up for launch into the Nigerian market include: MG ZS, MG RX8, MG HS and MG T60 pick-up. MG RX8, an extremely well-equipped 7-seater large-sized SUV, is reputed for offering huge amount of space without breaking the bank.

Yet in addition to other volume of safety features, the HS SUV is equipped with a 360-degree camera as well as front & rear parking sensors, heated mirrors, panoramic sunroof, 5-drive modes, multicolor ambient lighting, all-led headlights, Lane Departure Assist and Blind Spot Assist, resulting in an SUV that is as full of advanced features on the outside as it is on the inside. In addition, MG ZS is the brand’s compact SUV, which, from all indications, is out to give existing Compact SUVs in the country a run for their money. Loaded with technology, the MG ZS features a unique and striking exterior and interior.

MG Motor is a British automotive company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, and a subsidiary of SAIC Motor UK, which in turn is owned by the Shanghai-based Chinese state-owned company, SAIC Motor. Although MG Marque went through a change of ownership less than a decade ago, what never changed has been the quality standard of the brand, which is why, till date, engineering and styling designs of all modern models of MG are majorly the responsibility of the brand’s design engineers located at its Longbridge facilities in the United Kingdom, a center also retained for Research and Development.
