Bode George, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has asked Bisi Akande, a former governor of Osun state, to withdraw his recently released autobiography, ‘My Participations’. The book has elicited reactions from political stakeholders, including Olagunsoye Oyinlola, former governor of Osun, and Ayo Adebanjo, acting leader of Afenifere, who have denied claims made by Akande. George, in a statement on Thursday, described the book as “shameful” and said the author needs to apologise to Yoruba elders. The former deputy national chairman of the PDP also warned Akande against “setting his house on fire” because of Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Akande must apologise openly to Yoruba elders. The attitude that he displayed is not acceptable in a civilised society. Is it his legacy to dishonour Yoruba elders?” the statement reads. “At his age, Akande should not set his house on fire because of Tinubu’s ambition. I felt very bad as a Yoruba man and as a Nigerian. He has maligned Yoruba elders and highly respectable people in the country. “He was busy giving kudos to Bola Tinubu. Baba Akande is from Osun State and Tinubu is the only man that he could single out to praise. “From the reaction to his book, you must have heard what Baba Adebanjo said. How are we going to be regarded by others? Is that the right thing to do? “Baba Akande should withdraw the book that he has authored. It is very shameful. He is older than me and I don’t expect an elderly person to behave in that manner. He must apologise to those he has offended.”
