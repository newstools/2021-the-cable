The World Health Organisation (WHO) has appointed Ayoade Alakija, a Nigerian doctor, as its special envoy for the access to COVID-19 tools accelerator (ACT-Accelerator). The ACT-accelerator partnership is a global initiative offering an integrated, end-to-end solution to end of the pandemic through the accelerated development and equitable distribution of vaccines, tests and treatments. In a statement on Thursday, the organisation said Alakija will join Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden, in the same role. The WHO said she will help lead the collective advocacy for the ACT-accelerator, mobilise support and resources so the organisation can deliver on its strategic plan that was launched on 28 October 2021. According to the statement, Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said Alakija’s appointment comes at a critical point in the fight against COVID, with the Omicron variant threatening to further constrain equitable access to vaccines. “Dr Alakija brings a tremendous track record in advocating for equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments, especially for Africa. We are very much looking forward to working with her to advocate for the full financing of the ACT Accelerator, and to meeting the global targets for COVID-19 vaccination, testing and treatment,” he said. On her part, Alakija said: “I come to this role to serve and to be part of a team that will ensure that the fruits of our collective work bring meaningful access and dignity in health in this pandemic that is felt in every village, town and city.” Alakija is a medical doctor with a masters degree in public health and epidemiology from The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She currently serves as co-chair of the Africa Union Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance for COVID-19 (AVDA), and was a former chief humanitarian coordinator for Nigeria.
