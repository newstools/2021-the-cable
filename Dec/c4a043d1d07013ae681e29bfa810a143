Sergio Aguero, Barcelona forward, has announced his retirement from football due to a heart condition. The Argentina striker was taken off during the first half of Barcelona’s 1-1 draw with Alaves after experiencing chest pain and dizziness. The 33-year-old was thereafter taken to hospital for cardiac tests, after which he was ruled out for three months. But on Wednesday, Aguero announced his retirement as reported on Barcelona’s website. “This announcement is to let you know that I have decided to stop playing professional football. It is a very hard decision,” he said. pic.twitter.com/QA9sXkgydS — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) December 15, 2021  “First of all, it’s my health; you know the problem I had a month and a bit ago. I was in good hands with the doctors, they told me that the best thing to do was to stop playing and I took this decision a week or 10 days ago. “I did everything I could to see if there was any hope, but there was not much hope. I am proud and happy for how my career went. “Since I was five years old I have dreamed of playing football, of being in the [Argentine] First Division, I never thought of going to Europe. “I want to thank Independiente, Atletico Madrid, who placed their faith in me when I was 18 years old, the people at City, who know how I feel, I have left the best. “To Barcelona, it has been incredible, I knew I was coming to one of the best clubs in the world, but things happen for a reason. And to the national team, which is what I love the most.” Aguero scored 436 goals in 802 games as a professional for Independiente (23 goals), Atletico Madrid (101), Manchester City (260), and FC Barcelona (1). He also scored goals for the Argentina national team — 9 for the youth teams and 42 as a full international. He won 15 trophies in England, including five league titles.
