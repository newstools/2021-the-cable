The Katsina government says it has ordered the restoration of telecommunication services in 13 LGAs across the state. Network services have been suspended in the state since September. Ibrahim Katsina, special adviser to Aminu Masari, governor of Katsina, on security matters, confirmed the development to NAN on Thursday. According to Katsina, the decision to restore network services was taken as a result of the relative peace recorded in the affected areas. The affected LGAs are: Jibia, Batsari, Safana, Kurfi, Danmusa, Dutsin-Ma, Kankara, Matazu, Musawa, Funtua, Faskari, Sabuwa, Dandume, Bakori, Danja and Malumfashi. Speaking on the shutdown of the network services, Masari had said it helped in addressing banditry in the state. “It is important because the informants give information to these bandits and now they have been cut off. The demand for ransom has also reduced,” he had said.
