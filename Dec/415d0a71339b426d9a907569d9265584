Ahmed Audi, commandant general of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), says collaboration among security agencies will help prevent insecurity in Nigeria. Audi, who said this on Saturday at Ilorin, emphasised the need for law enforcement agencies to cooperate in developing strategies towards strengthening Nigeria’s internal security architecture and making the country safe and secure. He said that lack of synergy is one of the factors militating against the successful fight against banditry, insurgency, kidnapping. “It is high time we dropped the toga of service supremacy and replaced it with a more reliable template for a more cordial relationship among all stakeholders involved in the fight against insecurity, this will help to restore the confidence of Nigerians in all security and law enforcement agencies,” he said. He called for the establishment of a “robust, concise and reliable intelligence-based fusion center” to win the fight against insecurity confronting the nation. The commandant general said the establishment of the crime fusion centre will help law enforcement agencies to share resources, expertise, and information.
