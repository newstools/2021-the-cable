The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested two Nigerians and a Ghanaian for drug trafficking. Femi Babafemi, NDLEA director of media and advocacy, said the suspects were arrested at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, and the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. Babafemi said 9.953 kilograms of cocaine and methamphetamine were intercepted from the suspects. He said one of the suspects — Uzoh Johnson — was arrested on December 8 at about 5.30 pm during an inward screening of Ethiopian Airlines passengers at the arrival hall of the Akanu Ibiam airport. According to him, Johnson, who arrived from Brazil via Addis Ababa, was arrested with clothes filled with cocaine, which had a gross weight of 6.7 kilograms. “While being interviewed by narcotic officers, Uzoh said he was given the consignment by his enabler in Brazil for which he would be paid N3 million upon successful delivery to someone in Nigeria,’’ he said. He added that Udeh Charles, another suspect, was arrested at the Enugu airport for ingesting 72 wraps of cocaine weighing 1.253kilograms. Babafemi said the suspect was arrested on December 3 during outward screening of Ethiopian Airlines passengers going to Rome via Addis Ababa. “He claimed he would have been paid 4,000 Euros on the successful delivery of the drugs in Italy where he has been living for more than 20 years,” Babafemi said. “He attributed his decision to engage in the ignominious trade on the downward turn of his business as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.” He added that John Kadja, a suspected Ghanaian trafficker, was arrested on Friday, December 3. Babafemi said Kadja was arrested with two kilograms of methamphetamine during an outward clearance of Qatar Airways from Abuja to Doha. “A search of his bag showed that the drug was concealed in a false bottom of his checked in luggage. He said he was travelling to Doha to work as a labourer,’’ Babafemi added.
