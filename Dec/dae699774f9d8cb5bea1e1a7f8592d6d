Amazon says it will be retiring Alexa.com, its web ranking service, in May 2022. Alexa.com is best known for Alexa Rank, a website that ranks the world’s most popular websites by monitoring traffic as web users navigate around. The service also offers paid subscriptions for those who want detailed search engine optimisation (SEO) analytics and insights. Amazon acquired Alexa Internet in 1999 for $250 million in stock, three years after it was founded. In a statement on its website, the Alexa.com team said the company stopped offering new subscriptions on December 8, 2021 — and it will shut down the site on May 1, 2022. “Twenty-five years ago, we founded Alexa Internet. After two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience, we’ve made the difficult decision to retire Alexa.com on May 1, 2022. Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more.” As of yesterday, December 8, it is no longer possible to renew or subscribe to new subscriptions on Alexa.com. Current subscribers will be able to access their accounts until May 1, 2022. The company said it will allow customers to export data on their Alexa accounts before the final shut down. The US-based e-commerce company did not provide a reason for shutting down the service.
