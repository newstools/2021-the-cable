Ola Ajayi, a young filmmaker, has premiered a video documentary on the white garment church. In an interview with TheCable during the premiere on Saturday, in Lagos, Ola said the documentary tells the true history of the white garment movement and Moses Orimolade, founder of the Cherubim and Seraphim movement. Ola, a daughter of Esther Ajayi, founder of Love of Christ Generation Church (LOC), said the story, narrated by Richard Mofe-Damijo, veteran Nollywood actor popularly known as RMD, also addresses the misconceptions about the Christian denomination. The prolific filmmaker stated that it took two years to execute the project, while she travelled to Ikare-Akoko with her crew to document the story. <img class="alignnone wp-image-639086 size-full" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="886" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1.jpeg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1-244x300.jpeg 244w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1-20x24.jpeg 20w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1-29x36.jpeg 29w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1-39x48.jpeg 39w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> “During Celebrate the Comforter programme which our church held in the United States in 2018, I was one of the stage managers behind the scene. And you know when you are behind the scene, you can see everything. I saw how beautiful everyone looked. Since then, it kept ringing in my head that I have to tell the story of this church,” Ola told TheCable. “I also made it my final year project pitch. I’ve been doing short films all my life. I told my mum about this idea and she introduced me to people that could make the production come to life. Then, I was introduced to RMD and I pitched my idea to him. I was nervous while pitching the idea to him. “This short idea eventually turned to something big. The documentary may not change all the misconceptions, but I believe it will make people see the church for what the founder intended it to be. Some of the practices in the white garment church today is not what the founder passed on. This documentary will give you a rich knowledge of the church.” The story was written by Ufuoma Metitiri and directed by Emmanuel Wogu. Ola added that she will be working on a bigger documentary project on the Celestial church following the success of the present project. <img class="alignnone wp-image-639087 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1024x767.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="674" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-24x18.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-36x27.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM-48x36.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.37.40-PM.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-639088 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-1024x767.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="674" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-1024x767.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-768x575.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-24x18.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-36x27.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM-48x36.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-12-at-10.48.16-PM.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />
