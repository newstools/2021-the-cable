Chelsea recorded a come-from-behind 3-1 victory over Aston Villa in their English Premier League (EPL) fixture at Villa Park on Sunday. After conceding midway through the first half, the stuttering Blues needed two penalties from Jorginho to stage the comeback. Reece James’ own goal gave Aston Villa the lead on 28 minutes before Jorginho, the Italian midfield maestro, equalised six minutes later. Romelu Lukaku, a halftime substitute, dispatched a glancing header 11 minutes after his introduction before winning the penalty dispatched by Jorginho deep into added time. Victory for Thomas Tuchel’s side moved the Londoners level on points with Liverpool in second position, six points behind Manchester City, the table-toppers who won 6-3 earlier in the day. Pep Guardiola’s side scored four first half goals and repelled a Leicester City comeback to win the nine-goal thriller at the Etihad Stadium. In other games, Arsenal made it four league wins on the bounce following a 5-0 victory over bottom club Norwich City at Carrow Road. In London, Antonio Conte continued his unbeaten league start as Tottenham manager as his side cruised past ten-man Crystal Palace 3-0.
