Kano youths on Wednesday marched to the office of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) to protest against insecurity in the north. The protest was staged by youths and members of the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) in Kano. Heavily armed security personnel made up of police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) barricaded the gate of the NUJ. Several security vehicles with personnel dressed in anti-riot outfits took over the outskirts and the road leading to the NUJ as the protesters assembled at a distance. Commenting on the rising insecurity in the country, Jamilu Charanchi, north-west coordinator, CNG, said the government has failed in securing the lives and property of Nigerians. “The excuses adduced by the federal government and its cronies in the pretext of rivalling the subsidy and promise of an N5,000 palliative to 40 million Nigerians are unfounded lies, unwarranted, fake, impracticable, ill-intended and unacceptably disgusting,” he said. “The current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and all the 36 state governments have failed totally in the major areas of providing security of lives and properties of citizens and ensuring a secure economic environment in the north in particular. “That the problems and sufferings in the north today without being compounded by a further hike in prices of essential commodities and mobility are traceable only to inept and insensitive leadership at national and state levels as well as the cowardice of other community and religious leaders who lack the courage to stand up to them in the interest of the people of the region and Nigeria.”
