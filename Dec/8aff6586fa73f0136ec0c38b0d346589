Aiteo, operator of oil mining lease (OML) 29, says it has finally put out the leak on its Santa Barbara wellhead in Nembe, Bayelsa state. The wellhead is a joint venture between Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO) and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). A wellhead is a component at the surface of an oil or gas well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface for the drilling and production equipment. It had blown on November 5, spewing oil and gas into the water bodies and causing environmental disaster — for many weeks after the initial leak. Last week, Andrew Onu, Aiteo’s global group director/coordinator, said the company had pumped chemicals into the wellhead to contain further leakage. He had said that the spill had already been contained substantially. In a statement on Wednesday, Aiteo said it has finally put out the leak and successfully installed control packages. “To the glory of God, we have put out the leak at SBAS-1. We are grateful for all the support. We have successfully installed control packages on both arms,” Thisday quoted a statement from Aiteo. “There’s a rig up pump on the long string, and pump opens the ball valve. Also, we have closed both control packages and shut-in well flow. The team is currently preparing to pump ‘kill fluid’ into the long string. Note that the short string is already killed and dead with zero pressure. “Complete pumping of kill fluid into the long string (LS). Achieve zero psi on surface and rig down pump as well as rig up wireline. “We will then nipple down Christmas Tree and carry out comprehensive service on wellhead and Christmas Tree as well as install it and secure well. Thereafter, we will clean-up wellhead platform and surroundings.” On Tuesday, the senate described the oil spill as unacceptable and urged relevant stakeholders to penalise the company.
