Rabi Shinkafi, commissioner for  women and children affairs in Zamfara, has resigned her appointment and taken up a job in Imo state. Shinkafi disclosed the development on Thursday in an interview with NAN in Gusau, the Zamfara capital. There had been speculations on social media about the reason for her resignation, as she was appointed as commissioner in Zamfara in November 2021. She, however, said the speculations about her resignation on social media are “completely false”, adding that it is the work of mischief makers. Shinkafi said Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, and his Zamfara counterpart, Bello Matawalle, who are both members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), have discussed the development. She also said her relationship with Matawalle and his wife is cordial, adding that they were involved in her decision to move to Imo. “I resigned my appointment as commissioner in Zamfara to enable me to pick another appointment as commissioner in Imo,’’ she said. “I am immensely grateful to governor Bello Matawalle and his wife, hajiya Aisha Matawalle, for their kindness to me and for giving me the opportunity to serve Zamfara in different capacities. “All the speculations on social media about my resignation are completely false; it was just the work of mischief makers. “I have a perfect and cordial relationship with the governor and his wife. I consider them as my family and they were in the picture of my going to Imo. “Both governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo and Matawalle discussed it as fellow All Progressives Congress governors and as friends too.”
