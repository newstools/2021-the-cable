Leicester City dampened Liverpool’s title challenge with a 1-0 win over the Anfield club in their English Premier League (EPL) clash at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night. Ademola Lookman scored the only goal of the encounter on 58 minutes shortly after coming on as a substitute. The Reds dominated from the start and won a penalty when Wilfred Ndidi, Super Eagles midfielder, brought down Mohamed Salah in the penalty area. The Egyptian striker, however, saw his spot-kick saved by Kasper Schmeichel while the 29-year-old’s rebound hit the bar. Jurgen Klopp’s side had several opportunities to take the lead but Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota were wasteful in front of the goal while Schmeichel was on hand to smother shots on target. The Reds could not find a way back into the encounter despite amassing 21 shots at goal. Liverpool succumbed to only their second defeat of the season. Liverpool stayed joint-second on 41 points from 19 matches, six points behind Manchester City. Earlier in the day, Tottenham were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Southampton, with Harry Kane’s penalty cancelling James Ward-Prowse’s lead for the home side. Conte maintained his unbeaten return to the EPL with a result that dented Tottenham’s top-four hopes. Emmanuel Dennis, Super Eagles striker, scored his eighth league goal of the season but could not prevent struggling Watford from succumbing to a 4-1 drubbing in the hands of West Ham United. RESULTS
