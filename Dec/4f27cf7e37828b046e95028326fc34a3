The military government in Sudan has shut down internet access in Khartoum, the country’s capital, in response to anti-coup protests. Military forces, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, had on October 25 arrested some members of Sudan’s transitional government and other civilian leaders including Abdalla Hamdok, the country’s prime minister. Hamdok was later reinstated on November 21 after signing a deal with the military promising elections for July 2023. But since then, pro-democracy supporters have staged several protests demanding civilian rule be restored According to the BBC, more than a hundred people were injured in clashes with police during last week’s protests and at least 44 people have been killed since the protests started two months ago. The security forces were also accused of sexually abusing more than a dozen women and girls. Prior to the internet shut down on Saturday, protest organisers were said to have planned a series of street rallies. Several bridges connecting Khartoum to other cities have also been closed by security forces. Reuters reports that Sudanese security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters in Khartoum as they marched towards the presidential palace on Saturday.
