One person has been reportedly killed by gunmen along Kaduna-Zaria expressway in Kaduna state. According to Daily Trust, dozens of passengers were abducted during the incident that happened on Monday night. The newspaper said the incident occurred around Gonar Magajin Gari, a community located along the expressway. The community is just a few kilometres from Zaria. A witness said the gunmen put up a blockade on the road before abducting passengers and ferrying them to an unknown location. “We were by the roadside when we noticed vehicles making abrupt U-turns on the lane to Kaduna from Zaria while other vehicles ran into the bush,” the witness said. “We also saw several motorists alighting from their vehicles in confusion and running on foot into bushes and we also ran.” Mohammed Jalige, spokesman of the police command in Kaduna, did not immediately respond to enquiry when TheCable contacted him.
