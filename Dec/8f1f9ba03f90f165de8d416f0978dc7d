Joshua Akinyemiju, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Oyo state, has advised churches to  adhere to the COVID safety protocol during special services fixed for December 31 and January 1. Akinyemiju said this on Friday in an interview with NAN in Ibadan, the Oyo capital. He said the safety precautions, which include maintaining 50 percent capacity in worship centres, are still in force. He also urged church leaders to always remind their congregation of the need to obey the rules and stay safe. “There is no divine protection for the careless. It is our individual responsibility to stay alive,” he said. Akinyemiju advised Christians to remain prayerful and depend on God for all their needs. He also urged Christians to be well informed and become actively involved in politics, just as he prayed to God to grant the heart desires of the citizens in the coming year. On his part, Samson Ajetomobi, chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) in Oyo, urged Nigerians to see the coming year as an opportunity to serve God and the nation better. “We should pray more than we ever did, sacrifice to defend the church more, be involved in issues that pertain to our lives, nation and the world at large,” he said. “2022 will be a better year. The Lord will save us from all forms of challenge and give us a peaceful year and a stable economy.”
