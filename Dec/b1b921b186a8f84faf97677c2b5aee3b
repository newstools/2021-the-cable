The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has announced four changes to the Super Eagles 28-man provisional list for the upcoming 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The changes were communicated in a statement released by the federation on Friday. The statement also confirmed TheCable’s report on Victor Osimhen pulling out of the team after testing positive for COVID-19. The 22-year-old is replaced by Henry Onyekuru. Emmanuel Dennis has also been chalked off the list after Claudio Ranieri’s claim that NFF had sent the player’s invitation later than the deadline stipulated by Watford FC. The in-form striker will be replaced by Peter Olayinka of Slavia Prague. Injuries have also forced the exclusion of Shehu Abdullahi and Leon Balogun from the squad. The duo will be replaced by Tyrone Ebuehi and Semi Ajayi respectively. Super Eagles will be hoping to win their fourth AFCON title when the competition kicks off in Cameroon on January 9, 2022. The team will take on Egypt in their first group game on January 11, before playing Sudan four days later. Their final group game will be against Guinea Bissau on January 19.
