Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has described Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), as a shining light. Speaking on Saturday at the public presentation of ‘The Arc of the Possible,’ a memoir of Adio, el-Rufai said the author is an example for public servants to imitate. El-Rufai, who was represented by Hadiza Balarabe, his deputy, noted that while in office, Adio demonstrated capacity and the desire to help make things better. “Waziri is a shining light. He made his mark as a journalist, public commentator before venturing into the public sector,” the governor said. “In the public service, he has demonstrated the capacity and the desire to help make things better. He is the remarkable case of an erudite commentator, demonstrating that he can also be a competent doer. “He came close to working with us when I was in the FCT, that didn’t happen, but a few years later we became classmates in a public policy programme in Havard. “I congratulate him on the book and the speed with which it is being published so soon after completing his tenure at NEITI, it is my hope that he will make himself available for further service. “Our country needs the best to remain engaged for top work required to set it on the proper path.” The governor added that Adio’s account will be useful for those still in public service, adding that it reflects the roles and challenges that can prepare those coming into service. “Public service is tough, but it is a necessary activity for building a better society. It helps to have the necessary preparation at this time,” the governor added.
