Acho Ndukwe, the traditional ruler of Amagu Ihube, and Paul Ogbu, ruler of Ihitte Ihube in Imo state, have been kidnapped by gunmen. The two communities are in Okigwe LGA of the state. The palaces of the two monarchs were set ablaze by the gunmen during the attack on Sunday. A youth leader in the Umulolo Okigwe area of the state was reportedly abducted by the gunmen while the country home of Fabian Nwosu, a community leader, was vandalised during the attack. “It was something else in the early hours of Sunday.

They also went to the house of Fabian Nwosu, on meeting his presence, they vandalised his house. “Eze Ndukwe is an influential king. He is the chairman of the Council of Traditional rulers in Okigwe LGA. He is also the chairman and CEO of Genesis Hotel, Okigwe. Nobody can comprehend this attack. The communities are bewildered.
