Some images showing corpses portrayed as victims of recent bandit attacks in Sokoto state have been circulated on social media. The north-west state has witnessed a series of bandit attacks lately, which have claimed many lives. On December 6, about 23 passengers were burnt to death in a bus attack in the state. A few days after, the bandits also returned to a village where they abducted many residents and killed two people. The images shared on Twitter and Facebook showed a lineup of some Muslims performing burial rites on corpses, while the other showed a burnt area. <img class="alignnone wp-image-642095 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-1024x892.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="784" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-1024x892.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-300x261.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-768x669.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-24x21.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-36x31.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM-48x42.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-21-at-11.27.37-AM.jpeg 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> A Twitter user, @DrHalimah with 1,926 followers, posted the images on December 10 with the caption: “The Sokoto Killings by Bandits.
