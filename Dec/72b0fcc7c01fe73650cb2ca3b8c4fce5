Donald Trump, former US president, was booed by an audience on Sunday when he revealed that he had received a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Trump made the comments during the final stop of his tour with Bill O’Reilly, former Fox News host in Dallas. According to a video tweeted by O’Reilly’s ‘No Spin News,’  O’Reilly said “both the President and I are vaxxed” and then asked Trump, “Did you get the booster?” Trump responded saying “yes” leading a portion of the audience to boo him. In a longer video tweeted by the site, Trump encouraged supporters to take credit for the vaccines, adding that COVID-19 was going to “ravage the country far beyond what it is right now” if the vaccines had not been developed. “Look, we did something that was historic, we saved tens of millions of lives worldwide. We, together, all of us, not me,” he said. “Take credit for it. It’s great. What we’ve done is historic. Don’t let them take it away. Don’t take it away from ourselves. If you don’t want to take it, you shouldn’t be forced to take it. No mandates. But take credit, because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don’t let them take that away from you.” In October, Trump, in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, had said he got vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and would consider taking the booster shot. In March, an adviser of Trump had told NBC News that the former US president and Melania Trump, his wife, quietly received COVID-19 vaccine in January, though the type of vaccine they received was not known. ”Well, I got the Pfizer and I would have been happy with any of them,” he said during the Yahoo interview, adding that he would have been happy with any of the vaccines. Asked if he will get the booster shot, Trump said: “If I felt that it was necessary and let’s see where this whole thing is going.” In August, Trump’s supporters booed him at a rally in Alabama, after he recommended that they should take the COVID-19 vaccine.
