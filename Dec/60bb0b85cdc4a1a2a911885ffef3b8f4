Chris Ngige, minister for labour and employment, says it is unethical for medical doctors to embark on strike. He spoke on Sunday at the induction of six University of Abuja (UniAbuja) medical graduates into the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN). Ngige advised the inductees, which include Andrew Ngige, his son, not to join any form of strike action. The minister said the medical profession is a noble one, hence, the new doctors should abstain from any conduct capable of bringing the profession to disrepute. “I am a medical doctor. One of you being inducted here is my second son. My first son is also a medical doctor. My daughter is also a medical doctor. By virtue of ethics, our oath as doctors is to save lives. That is our primary duty,” the minister said in a statement signed by Charles Akpan, deputy director, press and public relations in the ministry. “If doctors go on strike, people die. That is the truth. Human life is irreplaceable. How do you bring back people who have died as a result of doctors not being at their duty posts? “It is unethical for doctors to embark on strike. I have said it so many times in the past, and I will continue to say it. Doctors should not go on strike. Therefore, you should desist from going on strike in the interest of humanity and our noble profession.”
