Nigeria on Thursday recorded 1,139 cases of COVID-19. Here are five updates about the pandemic this Friday. China to impose new import restrictions over virus contamination fears China says it will impose new import restrictions from Saturday. Under the new set of laws, all producers of food shipped to China will have to register with the customs authority. The extra rules were previously required only for products posing potential health risks, such as seafood. But now coffee, alcohol, honey, olive oil, chocolate and several other products will also be scrutinised. New Zealand eases COVID crowd rules New Zealand has eased its rules on public gatherings — just in time for New Year’s Eve Crowds will now be allowed to gather in Auckland for the first time since August after the city’s COVID-19 traffic-light settings were moved from red to orange. Under orange settings, the bars, restaurants and cafes that enforce vaccine pass requirements can remove crowd size limits and the requirement to sit down, allowing people to dance the night away. Omicron wave peak may have passed, says South Africa South Africa says it may have passed the peak of its fourth wave of the COVID-19 infections and has therefore lifted overnight curfew rules. The government, in a statement released after a special cabinet meeting, said the Omicron variant, while highly transmissible, had seen lower hospitalisation rates than previous variants. The changes announced include lifting restrictions on movement between midnight and 4am. Businesses will also be allowed to sell alcohol under normal licensing rules, instead of closing at 11pm. Overnight curfew rules of varying severities have been in place since a national state of disaster was declared in late March 2020.

South Korea to extend social distancing rules South Korea says it will extend stricter social distancing rules for two weeks amid a surge in COVID-19 infections. South Korean Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum made the announcement during a COVID-19 response meeting, saying it was too early to be sure that the country overcame the pandemic.
