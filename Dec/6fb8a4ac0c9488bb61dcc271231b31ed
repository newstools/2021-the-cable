Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state, says the quest of young Nigerians to take over power will remain a tall order if they remain “political spectators”. Speaking at the national youth summit in Abuja on Thursday, Bello said the youth do not have an excuse not to lead the country. Represented by Jamiu Abdulkarim Asuku, his chief of staff, the governor said the young people must begin to see themselves as critical stakeholders in governance. “Youth no longer have any excuse not to take the lead,” he said. “We are not just youthful, we are useful and purposeful. This is the time for you to mobilise yourselves and begin an advocacy for youths involvement in governance. “Most of you sitting down here are above 30 years of age. At 32, General Yakubu Gowon was already head of state. He fought the civil war just for Nigeria’s survival as an indivisible and united entity. “General Murtala was also pretty young when he became the Head of State and he also made meaningful contributions to the development of our dear state. “The youth must begin to see themselves as critical stakeholders whose time has come to take over the leadership of this country. “Achieving this will remain a tall order if the new song of ‘Youth O’clock’ ends on your lips without concerted effort and commitment to participate in politics and electioneering processes in this country.” The governor said the youth should use 2023 to “craft the Nigeria of our dreams”. He added: “I challenge you to deploy your considerable resources of office and influence toward crafting the Nigeria of our dream, the youth O’clock song must be heard in every nooks and cranny of this country.”
