Three persons, including an inspector of police, were killed during a mob attack on a police station in Yagba-West LGA of Kogi state. The Kogi police command, in a statement on Thursday, said the incident occurred on Tuesday. According to the police, the mob attack followed robberies at three banks in Odo-Ere and Egbe towns in the LGA. William Aya, police spokesman in Kogi, said the police launched a manhunt for the robbery suspects and arrested two of them. He said the manhunt was done in collaboration with operatives of other security agencies, hunters and vigilantes and that it took the team to Oke-Ere Hills where the robbery suspects were trapped. “The two suspects who were arrested were taken to Odo-Ere police station. An irate mob from the community went to the station demanding that the two suspects be released to them for lynching,” he said. “All efforts by the police to placate the mob proved abortive; it became violent and in the process lynched one Insp Bamisaye Gbenga and injured PC Sunday Alechenu.” TheCable learnt in an attempt to disperse the crowd, a policeman fired shots which killed two people. The mob killed the policeman and subsequently set the station ablaze.
