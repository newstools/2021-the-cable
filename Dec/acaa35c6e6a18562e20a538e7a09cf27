Robert Kpanou, a Beninese, who was arrested during the #EndSARS protest in 2020 has been released from the Kirikiri maximum correctional centre. TheCable had reported that Kpanou was arrested on October 22, 2020 by officers attached to Marako police station while he was returning home from work. He was accused of stealing items from a supermarket looted during the violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests. Festus Ogun, his lawyer and a human rights activist, had told TheCable in October that Kpanou was arraigned before the Yaba magistrate’s court on November 3, 2020. He was subsequently remanded at the Kirikiri prison while awaiting the advice of the Lagos state director of public prosecution. On September 24, Kpanou appeared before the Yaba magistrate court, but the magistrate was absent. The case was consequently adjourned till December 17. On December 17, the case was withdrawn by the state government and it was struck out by L.A. Owolabi, the magistrate, with a release warrant issued. On Tuesday, Kpanou was released from prison after his lawyer had completed all the necessary documentation. In October 2020, many youths took to the streets nationwide to protest against police brutality under the #EndSARS movement. The protest started peacefully but was later hijacked by hoodlums.
