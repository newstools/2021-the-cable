The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Monday, locked out unvaccinated staff from its office headquarters in Abuja. George Ekpungu, secretary of the EFCC, said the commission will continue to “lock out” unvaccinated staff. Addressing journalists, Ekpungu said the measure became necessary due to the recent emergence of the Omicron variant in the country. According to NAN, as of 7am on Monday, staff of the anti-graft agency without evidence of being vaccinated were turned back home. TheCable had earlier reported that the federal government directed all civil servants to show proof of COVID tests and vaccination beginning from December. “The COVID-19 protocols were not instituted by the EFCC. They are international and national protocol,” Ekpungu said. “For those who said they will not take the vaccine, they will continue to stay locked out until they make a decision. “We also have vaccine at our clinic here for those who are interested.” He said Abdulrasheed Bawa, EFCC chairman, had given the directive to ensure all staff were vaccinated, adding that the commission’s management would decide on measures for those who have refused to be vaccinated. “You will agree with me that the cases of COVID-19 are on the increase worldwide and we must be on the lookout in order to ensure that our staff is safe,” he said. “We have been sensitising staff internally but felt the need to make it public to encourage others to copy from us.” So far, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported a total of six confirmed cases of the Omicron COVID variant in the country.
