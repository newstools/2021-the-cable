Rivers United on Sunday crashed out of the CAF Confederation Cup on aggregate after losing by a lone goal to Al Masry of Egypt. The Pride of Rivers were unable to consolidate on their 2-1 victory over their opponents in the first leg of the encounter which was held at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on November 28. Mohamed Abdel Letif scored the lone goal in the 12th minute that sent the Stanley Eguma-led boys packing from the competition on aggregate. The defeat comes after the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) club had alleged that its players and officials received death threats from fans of the Egyptian side. In the other match, Enyimba secured a 2-0 victory over Al-Ittihad of Libya in the play-off round of the CAF Confederation Cup in Aba. The lead-up to the clash was marred with controversy which forced the postponement of the first leg due to issues off the pitch last week. The People’s Elephant took to lead in the 21st minute as Sadiq Abubakar headed in a cross from Yakubu Bilal to put Enyimba in front. The second was added in the 34th minute, as Victor Mbaoma slotted the ball home to give the George Finidi-led boys a huge advantage into the second leg. As it stands, Enyimba are Nigeria’s only representative at the ongoing CAF confederation cup and a favourable result in the second leg will send them into the group stage.
