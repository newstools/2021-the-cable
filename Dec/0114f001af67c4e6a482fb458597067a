William Kumuyi, the general superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, had advised citizens against doubting if COVID is real or not. He spoke on Tuesday at a media briefing on the six-day crusade organised by the church on the theme, ‘The Great Miracle Explosion’. According to him, a pastor of the church became infected with the virus and had to go into isolation. “From my observation, I know that COVID-19 is real and it’s not fake. It’s not a politically-arranged thing. It’s real,” he said. “We’ve had people who had real COVID-19 situations and they were in isolation. In fact, one of our pastors was about passing on. According to him, he had said his last prayer, because in that isolation, he had seen other people dying. I knew about it and I called him on phone and prayed with him and within one hour, he was completely healed.” Speaking on the crusade, he said the programme will be an avenue for Nigeria to experience blessings. “What the Lord has been ministering to me is that when we put all the things that have happened this year in the global crusade, that’s a great expectation for this time. Virtually every life will be blessed,” he said. “Our decision makers — our leaders — when we allow this message to also reach them and to reach every family, the community and the nation, I believe that God is about turning us around.”
