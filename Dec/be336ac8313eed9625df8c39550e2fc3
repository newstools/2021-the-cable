Matthew Kukah, Catholic bishop of Sokoto diocese, says God did not make a mistake in making Nigeria one nation with diversity. Kukah said this on Sunday during the celebration to mark his 45th anniversary as a priest and 10 years as bishop of Sokoto diocese. Addressing the congregation, the bishop said he would not have been a priest without the support of his parents and the church, while admonishing the congregation to constantly remember that everything in their lives is God’s gift. Speaking further, he appealed to Nigerians to continue to be proud of the country at all times. “God did not make a mistake for making us a nation of diverse cultures, religions and ethnicities,” he said. “I talk about Nigeria with pride because before our very eyes, God will do a great thing that we will all rejoice with.” Kukah has, on several occasions, expressed his belief that Nigeria should remain as one nation. Earlier this year, the bishop said it is cheaper for Nigeria to remain as one country rather than breaking up into smaller units. He, however, added that those seeking to secede from Nigeria may be right regarding their concerns. A few months before, Kukah had declared that nobody stands to gain anything if Nigeria breaks up. “I don’t think any Nigerian, in his right sense, should pretend nothing binds us together. All of us are now global citizens but I know all of us are still nostalgic about this country,” he had said. “It is not going to remain like this and let none of us be under any illusion that anybody stands to gain anything if this country breaks up, nobody is interested in this country breaking up.”
