Ayo Adebanjo, acting leader of Afenifere, Yoruba socio-political group, says former President Olusegun Obasanjo has “a lot of questions to answer” over the death of Bola Ige. Ige, former attorney-general of the federation under the Obasanjo administration, was killed on December 23, 2001. However, conversations around the assassination of the former attorney-general have been reawakened by claims made by Bisi Akande in “My Participations,” his recently published autobiography. In the book, he accused the Obasanjo administration of reluctance in the pursuit of Ige’s killers. Akande also said some people in Obasanjo’s government decided to deal with Ige because of the late minister’s popularity. Reacting to these claims, Adebanjo, in a chat with AriseTV on Tuesday, said “Obasanjo’s government cannot claim innocence about the death of Bola Ige.” He added that “a lot of questionable deaths happened during the regime of Obasanjo”. “There’s no doubt that Obasanjo’s government cannot claim innocence about the death of Bola Ige. Nobody is disputing that, and as far as we are concerned, he has a lot of questions to answer. Because I don’t understand how the chief legal officer of the state with security people guiding him every time, will have security leave him as at the time the assassins came, claiming they go and eat,” the Afenifere leader said. “To be candid, a lot of questionable deaths happened during the regime of Obasanjo. On that score [ in the book of Bisi Akande], I think there’s a point for Obasanjo’s government to answer.”
