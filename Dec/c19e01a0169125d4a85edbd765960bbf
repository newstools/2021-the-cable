The presidential steering committee (PSC) on COVID-19 says it has initiated diplomatic steps to make countries that placed travel restrictions on Nigerians reverse their decision. Following the cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant reported in Nigeria, the United Kingdom had announced that non-UK and non-Irish citizens travelling in from Nigeria will not be allowed entry into the country. Saudi Arabia had also imposed a temporary ban on flights from Nigeria while Canada banned travel from Nigeria and nine other African countries over Omicron variant concerns. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation (SGF) and chairman of the PSC, said Nigeria has deployed science and data to measure the risks to the citizens, especially on the dangers of importation. “The PSC wishes to assure Nigerians that it has escalated all surveillance and control measures around our country,” he said. “It has similarly ramped up vaccination of eligible citizens and residents while making provisions for booster shots for those fully vaccinated. ”The PSC is working with mandate ministries to address the issues surrounding the restriction imposed by some countries on travelers from Nigeria on account of the Omicron variant. While each country is entitled to put in place measures to protect its citizens, Nigeria has similar responsibilities. “However, based on existing relationships, Nigeria has initiated diplomatic steps to make these countries reverse their course. This is ongoing in the interest of all parties concerned and we expect that positive results would emerge within the next one week.”
