The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) says it is not recruiting employees for any position in its offices. Garba Deen Muhammad, NNPC spokesperson, said this in a statement on Monday. He described information about an ongoing recruitment exercise at NNPC, which circulated on social media platforms, as “not true.” Muhammad, therefore, cautioned job seekers to disregard such information. The NNPC spokesperson also disowned a competition trending online which claimed to celebrate the company’s “anniversary event.” He advised the public to decline to participate in the survey as the company had nothing to do with it. “In the purported contest, unsuspecting participants are encouraged to carry out a survey by filling a questionnaire on their knowledge of the company,” the statement reads. “With the eventual winner standing a chance of winning cash reward of up to eight thousand U.S. dollars. “The NNPC has nothing to do with the purported anniversary event contest and is advising members of the public to decline any participation in the survey as it is a SCAM. “In the same vein, NNPC would also like to once again inform the public that the information circulating in the Social Media that NNPC is conducting a recruitment exercise IS NOT TRUE and the public should disregard it in its entirety. “The NNPC hereby reiterates that whenever it decides to conduct a recruitment exercise or send out information to the public, it will do so through authentic public communication channels, particularly the NNPC’s website.” In October, the NNPC had warned the public to disregard reports that it was recruiting.
