Bode George, chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says ‘My Participations’, the recently released autobiography by Bisi Akande, former governor of Osun state, was written to promote Bola Tinubu’s 2023 presidential ambition. Akande’s book has been generating reactions from prominent political figures in the country, including George himself. The PDP chieftain had earlier described the book as “shameful” and should be withdrawn. He also advised the author to apologise to Yoruba elders for “dishonouring” them. Buttressing his points in a chat with AriseTV on Monday, George said the author attempted to “bring everybody else down” while promoting Tinubu. He said publishing the book a few weeks to 2022 — “the year of politics in this country” — is a testament to the fact. “All he said in the book, the only man he was praising and didn’t condemn was Bola Tinubu. Do you think that is not political? Tinubu has thrown his hat into the ring that he wants to contest [for the presidency in 2023], and so he must bring everybody else down and start promoting him,” George said. “Today is December 20, and in another month, we will be heading into the new year in another week. And that is the year of politics in this country. What an appropriate time to now open up a pandora box, demonising some leaders and elders and the only man you can see and praise is your brother [ Tinubu]. Why did he come and launch the book in Lagos — he has never had anything to do with Lagos — if not to promote Tinubu?
