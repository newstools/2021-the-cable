Mutiu Adepoju, former Super Eagles player, has faulted the timing of the sack of Genort Rohr, with the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) a few weeks away. According to NAN, Adepoju spoke on Monday in Abuja. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had, on Sunday, announced the dismissal of Rohr and appointed Augustine Eguavoen, former Eagles captain, as interim coach of the team. The sacking came weeks after reports suggested that top brasses at the NFF wanted the Franco-German out of his role. Adepoju, while reacting to the news, said the the timing might hurt Nigeria’s chances at the upcoming AFCON. “This decision is something that has been expected. Fans are not satisfied with what the results of the team despite the fact that we have good and young players,” the ex-international said. “I am not also sure if the timing is good, but we will see with the result of the AFCON. Adepoju, however, added that Eguavoen would bring his experience to bear in the team. “Eguavoen is the Technical Director of the NFF, so, he is an insider and had been with the team long before now,” he said. “He has the experience and am sure he knows how to utilise the talents in the team for a great result.” Rohr was in charge of the Eagles for five years and four months, becoming Nigeria’s longest-serving manager. Eguavoen coached the Eagles to bronze medals at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt in 2006. He will now take charge of the team as it begins preparations for the 33rd edition of the tourney scheduled for Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022.
