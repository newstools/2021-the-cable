Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, says the state has planted over eight million trees in the past 13 years. He said this on Tuesday at a ceremony to kick off the 1,000-tree planting project organised by Naita Gupta, convener of the African Steel Evergreen Project. During the event, the governor said the state planted 60,000 trees during his administration. He encouraged Lagos residents to join the government’s efforts in preserving the environment by planting trees. “I want to ask everyone to push and encourage laudable initiatives like this so that we can preserve our Lagos ” he said. “We can preserve a place where we all call home and we can ensure that the future that is in the hands of teenagers who are here today is secured. We should plant more trees to save the environment.” Sanwo-Olu also spoke on the state’s commitment to reducing carbon footprint through projects such as the Lagos State Parks and Gardens (LASPARK) in order to preserve the environment for future generations. He commended the tree planting initiative and asked other residents of the state to join the effort for more trees to be planted in Lagos. In her remarks, Gupta said the tree planting initiative commenced on December 17, with the aim of planting 1,000 trees across Lagos before the end of the year. She said she is passionate about achieving a greener and cleaner Lagos, and urged Lagosians to cultivate the habit of planting trees.
