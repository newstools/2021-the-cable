Aung San Suu Kyi, former leader of Myanmar, has been sentenced to four years in prison by a special court. She was found guilty of inciting dissent and breaking COVID restrictions under a natural disasters’ law. Suu Kyi has been in detention since the country’s military toppled her civilian government on February 1. The coup came less than 10 years after the military handed over to a civilian government. Myanmar had been under military control until democratic reforms began in 2011. Suu Kyi faces 11 charges in total, all of which she denied. Other charges against her include corruption, violations of a state secrets’ act, and a telecoms law. If found guilty of all, she could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. Win Myint, Suu Kyi codefendant and former president, was also jailed on Monday for four years under the same charges. It is not yet clear if they will be sent to jail immediately or if other charges will be heard first.
