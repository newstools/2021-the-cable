The Coalition of Progressive Youths and Student Leaders (CPYS) has asked Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to support a young candidate as the party’s national chairman. The coalition said it will support Tinubu for the 2023 presidency if the former Lagos governor backs a youth to lead the APC. Samuel Olalere, convener of the coalition, on Sunday, said the APC must cater to the interest of youths in 2023. Olalere said Tinubu possesses the right mix of experience and network to lead the country after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. “Leadership, especially at the level of the presidency, is often not a function of brawl and physical strength,” he said. “This is why we believe that the President of Nigeria in 2023 should be a man with requisite maturity tapered with age, someone with proven ability to discover and deploy Nigeria’s vast human potentials and talents to advance the progress of the country. “The person that fit this bill in our considered estimation is Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the APC. “This is, therefore, a direct charge to Asiwaju Tinubu to not only lend support but also lead the way for our legitimate agitations for a younger National chairman of the APC at the February 2022 convention.”
