The Nasarawa government says it has banned the use and sale of charcoal in the state as part of efforts to protect the environment. Aliyu Agwai, permanent secretary, ministry of environment and natural resources, disclosed this on Saturday while addressing journalists in Lafia, the Nasarawa capital. According to NAN, Agwai said the process of producing charcoal is dangerous to the climate as it emits harmful fumes that are toxic to the environment and also intensifies global warming. “Cutting trees can result in the loss of habitat for animal species, which can harm the ecosystems,” he added. “Almost all the land animals and plants live in forests and many cannot survive the deforestation that destroys their homes.” He warned citizens against using and selling charcoal, adding that those who violate the law will be prosecuted. Agwai also commended residents for complying with the sanitation programme in the state. “Usually, every last Saturday of the month is set aside for sanitation exercise, but we brought it back to today because of the Christmas celebration,” he said. “We only allowed those with permission from the relevant ministry, or on essential services, to pass and move around during the exercise.” On his part, Abubakar Mohammed, chief environmental officer, said a mobile court in charge of environmental crimes has arraigned 32 suspects over violation of environmental sanitation laws in Lafia. He said the suspects have been sentenced to six months imprisonment with options of fine ranging between N5,000 and N50,000.
