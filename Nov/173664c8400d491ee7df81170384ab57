The house of representatives has asked Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff, and Alkali Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), to “take speedy action” to curb attacks on the Abuja-Kaduna highway. The lower legislative chamber passed the resolution on Wednesday after the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance sponsored by Abubakar Nalaraba, a lawmaker from Nasarawa state. Passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna highway have been targeted by gunmen recently, with several persons abducted and some killed. On Sunday, Sagir Hamida, a Zamfara governorship aspirant in the 2019 election, was killed by gunmen along the highway. Several other travellers were also kidnapped during the attack. Leading the debate on the matter, Nalaraba said the spate of the attacks “has caused a lot of panic in the hearts of citizens and travellers who ply that route”. “We are all aware of the present security challenges currently bedeviling this nation and we are also aware of how many Nigerians are being killed as a result of these incessant insecurity attacks,” he said. “We are no longer safe in this country. Abuja-Kaduna road is one of the busiest roads in this country especially during weekends where Nigerians, both prominent and high ranking, always ply. “It will interest you to know that even heads of security agencies, some of the top military personnel, generals cannot move freely from Abuja to Kaduna even with their escorts and high level of military attachment, not to even talk of the less privileged Nigerians.” Contributing to the motion, Ossai Ossai, from Delta, said a lot of money has been disbursed for security but not much improvement has been recorded. The lawmakers said the country may soon witness a food crisis because the roads are not safe for the transportation of agricultural produce. The motion was unanimously adopted after it was put to a voice vote by Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the house.
