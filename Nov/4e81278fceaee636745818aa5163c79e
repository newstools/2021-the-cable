Barcelona unveiled Xavi Hernandez as the club’s new head coach in front of thousands of fans at Camp Nou on Monday. The 41-year-old Spanish international has also signed a deal that will allow him to be in charge of the Blaugranas till 2024. Xavi was presented to the fans by Joan Laporta, the club’s president, to rapturous applause and cheers. He had, on Friday, departed Qatar-based Al-Sadd FC after Barcelona triggered his release clause. Addressing the excited fans at the unveiling, Xavi vowed to restore the club’s “DNA, work hard and rescue many things that were lost.” “Thank you all. I don’t want to get emotional, but I am. I feel goosebumps,” the Barcelona legend said. “This is the biggest club in the world, and I’m going to work hard to reach your expectations. Barcelona can’t accept a draw or a defeat. We have to win all the games. “I come prepared. My DNA didn’t change. We need to take charge, have the ball, create opportunities, be intense. We have a mission to rescue many things that were lost.” Xavi takes over from Sergi Barjuan, who had been in charge of the team since Ronald Koeman was sacked last month. Barcelona are currently ninth in La Liga, 11 points adrift of leaders Real Sociedad and 10 behind Real Madrid. Xavi left Barcelona in 2015 after helping the club win 25 trophies, including four Champions Leagues and eight La Liga titles, in 17 seasons.
