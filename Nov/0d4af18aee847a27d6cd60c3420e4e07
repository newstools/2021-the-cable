Orji Kalu, chief whip of the senate, has advised Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to consider the consequences of his actions. Kalu gave the advice on Monday when he visited Kanu at the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS) in Abuja. In the past few years, IPOB’s agitation for the secession of the south-east has heightened. The tension in the region has resulted in the loss of lives and properties but IPOB has often denied being responsible for the attacks. In a statement issued on Monday, Kalu said he advised the IPOB leader to consider his actions and utterances for the sake of the people. “This afternoon, I visited my brother, Maazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, Abuja. I met him in good health and care and we discussed as ‘umunne’,” Kanu said. “In 2001 when I was governor, I made his father Eze Israel Okwu Kanu the traditional ruler of Afara Ukwu and since then, the family has been very close to me. “I understand that Nnamdi has an insane amount of people rooting for him back home and I encouraged him to consider the consequences of certain actions and utterances for the sake of the same people. “Even though my ideology and his ideology are totally different, God has made us brothers and we can’t run away from each other. I owe him and Nigerians good counselling. “Whether he and his family listen to me or not, I will continue counselling him as I have always done in the past. What we need most is a peaceful and secured society.”
