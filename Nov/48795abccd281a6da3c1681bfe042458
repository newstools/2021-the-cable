Haliru Nababa, the controller-general of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), has suspended leave for personnel of the service. According to a statement by Francis Enobore, public relations officer of the service, Nababa also asked personnel to be on the alert during the yuletide. The prisons boss said this on Monday at an event held at the NCoS headquarters in Abuja. According to the statement, Nababa said the primary mandate of the service is to keep inmates safe. “We must, therefore, spare no effort in ensuring that those that are bent on violating the sanctity of custodial centres are prevented from doing so at all cost,” Nababa was quoted as saying. “To this end, all forms of leave are temporarily suspended.” Nababa explained that the measure is to ensure that adequate hands are available to provide safety for all custodial centres across the country. He also said efforts are ongoing to recapture fleeing inmates in collaboration with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). “Flagging the particulars of escapees is expected to facilitate re-arrests when they carry out e-transactions,” he said. The controller-general called on officers to remain dedicated and exhibit the highest level of professionalism in the discharge of their duties. There have been a series of jailbreaks at different custodial centres across the country in recent times. Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, had said about 3,906 inmates who escaped from different custodial centres are still at large.
