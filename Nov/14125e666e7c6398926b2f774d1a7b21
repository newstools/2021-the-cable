There is a heavy security presence around the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. The development comes amid reports of plans by aggrieved party members to protest at the national headquarters. Some Bauchi APC members had, on November 5, stormed the national headquarters to seek the intervention of the national caretaker committee in the crisis rocking the party in the state. Speaking with journalists on the presence of security operatives, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC caretaker committee, said it’s a measure to safeguard the premises. “They have been there several times whenever we need to safeguard the secretariat,” he said. “You are not in the position to read security reports. So, you cannot ask me. If something happens now, they will say ‘what were they doing?’ “There are so many things that have to do with security that you are not aware of. It’s a routine thing. The police liaise with the FCT minister, the IGP and other people if they have any information. “Not only here, if you are coming to Abuja, going to the airport, we have the duty to protect the people who work here. We read security reports and I’m sure you are fully aware we have every security agency in our secretariat. “We are only acting on security reports, there is no cause for alarm.”
