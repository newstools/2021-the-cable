The Association of Arewa Community in Igboland, a political pressure group, has asked Nigerians to support the Igbo in their bid for the presidency in 2023. At a media briefing in Umuahia, Anambra capital, on Sunday, Mohammed Umaru, the association’s national president, described the Igbo as “accommodating”. Umaru said it is important to support the Igbo people to actualise their presidential ambition. “The north, west and south-south have all ruled the nation as executive president. This is the time we should give our consent for an Igbo executive president,” he said. “Our people should give them benefit of the doubt to lead the country in the next political dispensation and if they perform well we can allow them a second chance. “We, all the northern people living in Igbo land, are highly in support of an Igbo executive president. “Here, we live and earn our living in Igbo land and we will like to continue to live as an indivisible entity to work and operate our businesses.” He appealed to the Igbos to unite and produce a detribalised person that would contest the 2023 presidential election. He said the group had begun consultations, and expressed optimism that other political zones would support the agenda. “We should not fan the ambers of hatred because where there is war, nothing is secured,” he said.
