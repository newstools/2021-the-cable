A yet-to-be-confirmed number of shops were destroyed on Tuesday night, following a fire outbreak at the Nyanya market in Abuja. The inferno was said to have started at past 7pm. The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Traders were seen lamenting, as some of them attempted to salvage their goods. However, the inferno was brought under control following the intervention of firefighters. It isn’t yet clear if there were casualties as a result of the incident. The development comes days after a fire outbreak at the Kubwa market in Abuja. The fire, which occurred on November 5, began after a kerosene tank exploded in the market. At least five people were confirmed dead after the Kubwa market fire, while 11 others sustained injuries. Following the fire outbreak, the federal capital territory administration (FCTA) had warned traders against illegal distribution of fuel products. Illegal structures at the market area were also destroyed after the fire.
