Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo says civil servants are inspired to perform better when their workplaces are conducive. He said this on Monday during the unveiling ceremony of the Chike Edozien secretariat complex in Asaba, the Delta capital. The secretariat complex is named after Chike Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba. The vice-president also commended Ifeanyi Okowa for the completion of the secretariat, despite economic challenges. “Such a public service requires training, and capacity building but also workspaces that are well equipped, conducive, and inspirational,” he said according to a statement by Laolu Akande, his spokesman. “We have heard already how inspired the public servants today are and they are even spending long hours in the office. This is very commendable indeed. Public servants require environments that bring out the best in them. This secretariat complex will provide such an environment. “In naming this building after his royal majesty, you are not just celebrating a highly respected and deserving son of Delta State and Nigeria, you are also signaling the sort of excellence in public service that we wish to see incubated within this complex. “But perhaps more importantly, you are saying to a generation, not old enough to be employed in the civil service today, that integrity, diligence, and service to community and country still pay.
