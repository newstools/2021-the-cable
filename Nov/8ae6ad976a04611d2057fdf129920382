The 2021 Daily Trust Golf Championship would tee off on the 18-hole course of Ibom Icon Hotel Uyo, Akwa Ibom state on December 4. The organisers of the event disclosed this on Saturday. The one-day golf event, packaged by Media Trust Limited, publisher of Daily Trust newspapers, has generated wide range of interest among golf stakeholders in the public and private sectors of the country. According to the organisers, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), NNPC, defence headquarters, Nigerian navy, RwandAir, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturers and Akwa Ibom state government are among sponsors for the championship whose strict pre-registered status would ensure that registration of participants ends on November 27, one week to the tee off. Highlight for the championship would be RwandAir business class tickets for an all expense-paid golfing weekend in Kigali for winners in the male and female categories — after about 120 amateur golfers would have competed — three-night stay in a five-star hotel in Kigali, two-rounds of golf at the premier 18-hole Kigali Golf Club. Ahmed I. Shekarau, general manager, business and strategy, Daily Trust, said the tournament would accommodate the cream of Nigeria’s golf players, captains of industry and special guests. “We made the conscious decision to promote the golf through the Daily Trust Golf Championship because golf’s growing popularity among the country’s prime movers has elevated the sport to a strategic meeting point for the elite class,” Shekarau said. “Golf creates the opportunity for business networking and therefore serves as an ideal course to enhance the drive for unity of purpose by citizens, especially at this challenging period for our country.” The Daily Trust golf championship, an amateur competition, debuted in 2018 in Abuja.
