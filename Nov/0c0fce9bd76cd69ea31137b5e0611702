The Nasarawa state police command says it foiled an attempt by gunmen to abduct Umar Nasiru-Black, Nasarawa-south zonal chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). According to NAN, Ramhan Nansel, the state police spokesman, disclosed this in the statement on Sunday. Nansel said the police received a distress call on November 20 around 8:30 pm that six gunmen had invaded Nasiru-Black’s residence, located at Bukan kwato area of Lafia, and were attempting to kidnap him. “Upon the receipt of the information, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Adesina Soyemi, immediately mobilised police patrol teams to the scene,” the statement reads. “The abduction was foiled due to the prompt intervention of the team mobilised by the commissioner and members of the community.” Nansel said in a bid to escape, the hoodlums hit the zonal chairman with a stick on his forehead. He said they also shot one of the victim’s neighbours in the right leg before escaping into a nearby bush. The spokesman said the PDP chieftain, along with his neighbour who was shot, was taken to a hospital for treatment, adding that they are in stable condition. He, however, said efforts were ongoing to arrest the fleeing kidnap suspects. Nansel called on the public to always inform security agencies of suspicious activities in their areas, for prompt response.
