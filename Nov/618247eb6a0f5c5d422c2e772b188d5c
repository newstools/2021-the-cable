The judicial panel set up by the Lagos government to probe cases of police brutality — including the Lekki shooting — says protesters were killed at the tollgate in what could be described in the context of a “massacre”. On October 20, 2020, in what appeared to be an attempt to disperse protesters, officers of the Nigerian Army stormed the Lekki tollgate and started shooting. Police officers were also said to have been present at the tollgate area as well. There have been varied reports on the activities of security operatives at the tollgate. In a report on its findings, which was submitted to the Lagos government on Monday, the panel said protesters were killed at the tollgate, adding that security operatives prevented ambulances from reaching injured demonstrators. “At the Lekki Toll Gate, officers of the
Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre,” the report, as seen by TheCable, reads. “The Panel also found that the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement. “The Panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officers shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths.”
