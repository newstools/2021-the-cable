Kabir Marafa, a former senator representing Zamfara central, says Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national caretaker committee, is on a mission to “kill” the party. He said this in reaction to the parallel congresses that were held at short notice in Zamfara at the weekend. There was one congress by the Governor Bello Matawalle-led faction while Marafa’s faction conducted another one. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Sunday, the former legislator wondered how the APC will give a 24-hour notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before conducting congresses in the state. He argued that the move by the party is alien to section 85 of the electoral act, adding by law, the electoral body should be given a 21-day notice before a congress of any party is held. “This confirms to us that the Mai Mala-led APC, as it is today, is on a mission to destroy APC,” he said. “But we don’t care, they have a right to destroy APC but in Zamfara we have interested parties and it is our state and we are not ready to destroy our own house and anybody desirous of doing so we have a right to say no. “The essence of this briefing is to tell Nigerians why there is a faction again in Zamfara. Let everyone know that this faction came about because of the way and manner APC national is trying to suppress us in Zamfara state. “Now APC looked for our trouble, we did not look for APC trouble. We did everything possible to accommodate our new visitor (Matawalle) but APC at all the points frustrated us. “It appears APC national headquarters is at loggerheads with rules and procedures.”
