Two people were killed by gunmen at a traditional wedding ceremony at Uquo community in Esit Eket LGA of Akwa Ibom. According to NAN, Usoro Akpanusoh, a member of the state house of assembly, confirmed the incident on Tuesday. Akpanusoh said the gunmen came to the ceremony with the intent to abduct him, but he was lucky to escape after struggling with one of them. “I went for traditional marriage in Uquo in Esit Eket with the family of the deputy political leader of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in my ward,” he said. “After staying for about 40 minutes, I bade the couple goodbye and approached my car. “While attempting to enter my car, I saw a Nissan Sunny that blocked it and a guy came out with an AK-47 rifle and started shooting sporadically into the air and people thought that he was a policeman. “I saw him pointing the gun at my car and started shooting at people directly and bullets hit two guys.” Akpanusoh, who said the event occurred last Thursday, added that one of the gunmen attacked his driver. “Fortunately, the driver struggled with the guy and as God would have it, he was able to find his way back to the crowd,” he said. He said many other people were injured and rushed to the hospital. Reacting to the incident, Odiko Macdon, police public relations officer in Akwa Ibom, said the commissioner of police had asked the divisional police officer in Esit Eket to investigate the incident. “We are aware of the attempt to abduct the house member and the police are trying to determine the extent of the crime,” Macdon said.
