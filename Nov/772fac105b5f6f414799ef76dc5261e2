On Saturday, several posts on social media and blogs claimed that Hope Uzodinma, governor of Imo, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) will challenge the outcome of the ongoing Anambra governorship election in court. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is currently conducting the governorship election across 21 LGAs in the state and the final result has not been declared yet. However, the viral posts online claimed that the governor reacted to the Anambra governorship election in a statement as the results from most polling units were being announced. <img class="alignnone wp-image-626379 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-1024x846.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="744" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-1024x846.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-300x248.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-768x634.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-24x20.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-36x30.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001-48x40.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0001.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-626380 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-631x1024.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-631x1024.jpg 631w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-185x300.jpg 185w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-15x24.jpg 15w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-22x36.jpg 22w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002-30x48.jpg 30w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG-20211107-WA0002.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /> On Facebook, a news blog — Igbere TV — with over 200,000 followers posted the claim. The post has garnered over 600 shares, 2,000 comments and reactions. “Not even INEC can intimidate the APC candidate for the Anambra Governorship election. We’ve gotten lots of signals over the malpractices going on in different ward (sic) of the state,” the governor was quoted to have said. “We are peace abiding Political Party but if anything undemocratic goes on in this election and the collation of Polling Units results, we have no other options than to challenge the election process in the court of law.” On Twitter, some users claimed the governor said the results of the election will be contested at the supreme court. “We will challenge Anambra election results to the Supreme Court,” a user wrote. We will challenge Anambra election results to the Supreme Court-Hope Uzodinma pic.twitter.com/BVQ0K7vK20 — chijiоke, Ph.D., Nuclear Engineering(Affidavit). (@Ekwulu) November 6, 2021  BACKGROUND On January 14, 2020, the supreme court sacked Emeka Ihedioha as governor of Imo, affirming Uzodinma as winner of the March 9, 2019 election. Uzodinma had come fourth in the election with 96,458 votes, according to the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Owing to the supreme court declaration, Uzodinma has often been regarded as the “supreme court governor” — a tag that the governor had rejected saying it is “height of ignorance” to call him such a name. VERIFICATION The post claimed that the governor made the comment in a press statement. A review of the verified pages of the governor and Imo state media shows that such statement was not issued by the governor. Also, no credible news platform has published the statement credited to Uzodinma. When TheCable reached out to Oguwike Nwachukwu, chief press secretary to Uzodinma, he said the statement didn’t emanate from the governor. “Governor Hope Uzodimma follows credible avenues to communicate to the public. He will never shy away from using those appropriate channels any time he wants to say something of public interest,” Nwachukwu said. “He talks to the media directly or indirectly through his designated competent officials. He can issue statements and statements can also be issued on his behalf.” VERDICT The claim that Uzodinma said the APC will challenge the Anambra governorship election at the supreme court is misleading.
