The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has extended the deadline for the submission of bids and initial bid deposits (IBDs) for the upcoming auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum The spectrum will be utilised for the early deployment of 5G technology services in the country. Ikechukwu Adinde, NCC director of public affairs, announced this in a statement on Tuesday. He explained that the commission shifted the deadline from today, November 24, to Monday, November 29, due to recent flight delays which could have affected prospective bidders. On Tuesday, TheCable had reported that the Nigerian Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) embarked on “flow control” for two days in protest of the death of Aniekan Effiong Inuk, an air traffic controller. On the 5G, NCC said it plans to auction two lots of 100 MHz TDD slots available in the 3.5 GHz band to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband services. The two lots are in the 3500-3600 and 3700-3800 MHz frequency and will be offered on a technology-neutral basis for the provision of communications. The NCC has already pegged the reserve price for each lot of the spectrum at $197.4 million (N75 billion). The auction is scheduled for December 13, 2021. “The Nigerian Communications Commission invites the public to note that the submission of responses in respect of the 3.5 Gigahertz Spectrum Band auction was scheduled to close on Wednesday, 24th November 2021,” the statement reads. “However, due to the challenges posed to air travels as witnessed recently and considering that it may have some impact on intending bidders regarding the submission of their bids, the Commission hereby extends the deadline for submission of bids and Initial Bid Deposits (IBDs) to 5.00 pm on Monday, 29th November 2021. “All other events as scheduled in the Information Memorandum remain unchanged.”
