A truck belonging to Skyway Aviation Handling Company Plc (SAHCO), on Sunday, collided with a Max Air aircraft at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The incident was said to have occurred in the early hours of Sunday. Henrietta Yakubu, spokesperson of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), confirmed the development to TheCable on Monday. “The SACHCO truck had a brush with Max Aircraft,” she said via a text message. The truck was reportedly on course to provide services when it collided with the aircraft, causing damage to the vehicle and aircraft. It is not immediately clear if passengers were on board the aircraft when the incident occurred. A similar incident happened in 2015 at the Murtala Muhammed international airport in Lagos — two aircraft belonging to FirstNation Airways collided at the second terminal of the airport. About 250 passengers were on board during the incident. One of the aircraft was taxiing from the runway to MMA2 to disengage passengers while the other aircraft was preparing to take off to Port Harcourt airport from the same terminal. Following the incident, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) grounded both aircraft immediately while the airline asked passengers to disembark. Tickets for the Port-Harcourt bound passengers were also refunded.
