Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, has lifted the ban on telecommunication services in the state. The Nigeria Communications Commission(NCC) had in September instructed all telecommunications companies to shut down their services in Zamfara over lingering insecurity in the state. In October, the governor had directed telecommunication companies to restore network service in Gusau, the state capital city. At the state congress of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gusau on Saturday, Matawalle announced the decision for telecommunication services to restore services in other parts of the state. The governor said the NCC would release all the networks by Monday. Matawalle said that banditry and kidnapping had been substantially suppressed within the period of the telecom shutdown and that his administration was satisfied with the current security situation in the state. “I want to announce today that we have taken a decision to lift the ban on telecommunications in the state,” he said. “God willing, as from next Monday, we shall have that effected. “The decision was due to encouraging reports of successes achieved in the state from those stringent measures.” The governor said that security forces were still flushing out and arresting remnants of the bandits and their collaborators. Matawalle commended the residents for their resilience and patience during the three months of network suspension.
