The Super Eagles maintained the top spot in their 2022 World Cup qualifying group after a 2-0 victory over Liberia on Saturday. Gernot Rohr made two changes from the win over the Central African Republic, as Wilfred Ndidi and Alex Iwobi returned to the squad. The Eagles looked comfortable in the opening exchanges and raced in front, thanks to Victor Osimhen’s dangerous spot-kick on 15 minutes. Kelechi Iheanacho was illegally stopped by goalkeeper Boisen de Souza in the box and the referee pointed to the penalty spot. Shortly before the half-hour mark, Jamilu Collins had the ball in the net after a good through ball from Iheanacho, but it was ruled out for offside. Another chance arrived in the 32nd minute. Iheanacho again orchestrated another brilliant move. He found Osimhen this time with a ball over the top, but the Napoli striker fired off target with only the goalkeeper to beat. Peter Butler’s men were quick to close the Super Eagles down as the first half continued, but they were unable to trouble Maduka Okoye who enjoyed a quiet first half. The Lone Stars were threatening after the halftime break, but Nigeria quickly regained momentum as Osimhen came close to doubling the lead for the three-time African champions just after the hour mark. Looking to manage the game in the last ten minutes with a tactical change, Rohr brought on Ahmed Musa to replace Iheanacho. Two minutes into injury time, Osimhen won Nigeria another spot-kick and Musa picked up the ball and struck it beyond the keeper for the assurance goal. In the end, Osimhen and Musa’s goals were enough to do the job as Nigeria sits atop the group ahead of a tough encounter with Cape Verde.
