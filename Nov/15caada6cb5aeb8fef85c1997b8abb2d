The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says it is working to establish learning centres for out-of-school children in Benue state. Speaking to journalists on Saturday, Ibrahim Conteh, UNICEF field officer in Benue, expressed concern over the absence of schools to accommodate the children at the camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the state. Conteh said the learning centres will be set up at the Ukpam IDP camp in Guma LGA of Benue state. During a monitoring visit to Daudu and Ukpam camps, the UNICEF field officer expressed concern that the facilities for IDPs lacked basic services on education, health and sanitation. While commenting on the the unavailability of schools, he said children are “currently receiving lessons under trees” due to lack of learning facilities. According to him, UNICEF will partner with the state government and stakeholders in the education sector to ensure that learning centres are established for 3,000 children. According to NAN, he also said UNICEF inaugurated four-unit toilets with 20 rooms at the Ukpam camp, and urged residents to secure the property against vandals. He also called on the Benue state water and sanitation agency to support the repairs of major facilities at the Daudu IDP camp.
