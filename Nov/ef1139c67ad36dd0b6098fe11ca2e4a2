Abductors of the members of the Baptist Church in Kakau Daji, Chikun LGA of Kaduna state, have reportedly demanded N99 million as ransom. Joseph Hayab, vice-chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 northern states and Abuja, disclosed this on Friday in an interview with journalists in Kaduna. Gunmen had invaded the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Kakau Daji, Chikun LGA of Kaduna state, on October 31 and killed two persons, while several others were kidnapped. CAN had later said out of the 66 persons abducted, two were killed, while three others were injured and taken to the hospital. Earlier in November, Hayab had expressed concern over the safety of those still in captivity and called for urgent intervention by government and security agencies. “The lives of the abducted Kaduna worshippers are in danger and require urgent intervention of government and security agencies,” he had said. “CAN in Kaduna state is appealing to well meaning individuals, organisations, those in authority, especially the federal government and the international community to come to our rescue. “The evil we are experiencing is more than what an ordinary person in Kaduna and Nigeria can handle. CAN is appealing to all Christians and people of our state to be united in fighting this evil and be watchful.” Speaking at the media briefing on Friday, Hayab also said one of the four remaining students abducted from Bethel Baptist High School in Damishi, on July 5, has been released. He said N5 million ransom was paid to the bandits for the release of the student. On July 25, the first set of 28 students were freed after the bandits reportedly collected a ransom of N100 million. Since the release of the first set, a total of 117 students have regained their freedom in batches. Ransom was said to have been paid on each batches of the students released.
