Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, says the armed forces of Nigeria do not engage in dishonorable activities. Irabor spoke on Tuesday while fielding questions from journalists at an event in Benin City, the Edo capital. The defence chief was responding to questions on the report of the Lagos judicial panel of inquiry which was submitted to the state government on Monday. According to the report seen by TheCable, the panel said its findings revealed that the army and police shot at protesters who had gathered at the Lekki tollgate in October 2020. Speaking on the development, Irabor said he couldn’t say much on the panel’s findings until he sees the full document. “Whether it’s a true report, I can’t tell. But I will like to indicate that the normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the convening authority,” NAN quoted him as saying. “Then, there will be a white paper presented based on which one can then make informed comment. “But whatever it is, currently, I will like to indicate that the armed forces of Nigeria is a professional armed forces which remain committed to constitutional mandate. “If there are issues, of course, we’ll address them within the ambit of the divisions. “It will not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of the nation is kept intact. “So, until I see the full report, I may not be able to say anything. But I can assure you that the armed forces of Nigeria are well disciplined and do not engage in ignoble acts.”
