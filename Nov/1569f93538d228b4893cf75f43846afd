Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), says President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended the inauguration of the newly constituted board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC). In a statement on Tuesday, Mustapha said the government will announce a new date soon. The federal government had fixed Wednesday, November 24, as the inauguration date. “President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the immediate suspension of the inauguration of the newly constituted Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited scheduled for Wednesday, November 24, 2021, until further notice,” the statement reads. “A new date for the inauguration of the board will be announced in due course. “We deeply regret inconveniences caused to members by this suspension, please.” In September, Buhari appointed the new board members of the NNPC and set a two-year timeline for the incorporation of NNPC Limited. Ifeanyi Ararume was appointed as chairman of the board while Mele Kolo Kyari and Umar I. Ajiya will serve as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. Other board members are Tajudeen Umar (north-east), Lami O.
