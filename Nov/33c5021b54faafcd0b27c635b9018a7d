Youth and Student Advocates for Development Initiative (YSAD), a non-profit organisation, on Wednesday, took its campaign against road extortion to the police headquarters in Abuja. Addressing officers including Frank Mba, the force’s spokesperson, Obinna Nwagbara, chief executive officer (CEO) of YSAD, said the ongoing campaign against extortion of motorists by security operatives is to tackle the illegal practice. He said YSAD embarked on the campaign to call on authorities to address the menace which is part of the grievances of the 2020 #ENDSARS campaigners. He said if not nip on the board, “the next implosion could wreck the very foundation of the country”. Nwagbara said YSAD has adopted a multi-stakeholder approach in tackling the problem, adding that the campaign have been taken to other agencies including the National Human Rights Commission and the National Orientation Agency. In his remarks, Mba thanked the groups for their interest in tackling the social problem. The police spokesperson said the challenge can only be tackled by adopting holistic measures, engaging stakeholders and being sincerely committed to the project. Among the campaigners were members of Eaglepost Media Advocacy Group and Voice.
