The Kaduna government has lifted a partial three-month telecommunications shutdown in the state. In October, the state government took the measure in an effort to tackle the criminal activities of bandits in the state. Addressing a press conference on Friday, Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, said the relevant government agencies have been directed to liaise with the telecommunications operators to restore full services in the state. The commissioner said the telecommunications shutdown helped the security agencies achieve “some results”. “The security agencies have now notified the government that telecom services can be restored,” he said. “Along with the other measures in the security containment order, the telecoms shutdown had helped the security agencies to achieve some results, which the security forces will reel out soon. “The prolonged application of this measure was always out of the question, due to its impact on the legitimate activities of citizens and businesses. “Residents are advised that the restoration of full services in the affected areas may unfold over a few days, as the service providers mobilise to power and boost their transmission systems accordingly. “The Kaduna state government regrets the inconveniences residents of the affected LGAs may have encountered as a result of the  shutdown. The state government wishes to commend the sacrifices made by residents while this temporary measure lasts.” The commissioner said the prohibition of the use of motorcycles all over the state, the ban on weekly markets and transportation of cattle across the state are still in force.
