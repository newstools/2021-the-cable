The UK has recorded two cases of Omicron — the new highly infectious COVID-19 variant. According to the BBC, Sajid Javid, the British health secretary, said the two cases were detected in Chelmsford, Essex, and in Nottingham. He said the cases are currently self-isolating, and that tracing and tracking of their contacts is in progress. The World Health Organisation (WHO) described Omicron as a “variant of concern”, calling on global leaders to take action to contain its spread. The UK, US and EU countries have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from southern Africa. The index case of Omicron was detected in South Africa. Cases of the COVID variant have now been detected in Belgium, Hong Kong, Israel and Botswana. The Nigerian government is yet to make any announcements on the emergent variant and measures to prevent its spread to Nigeria.
