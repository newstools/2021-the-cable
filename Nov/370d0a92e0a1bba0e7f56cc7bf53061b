Supporters of Sunday Adeyemo, the separatist activist better known as Sunday Igboho, staged a protest on Saturday to demand his release. According to NAN, the protesters carried placards with various inscriptions, while calling on the federal government to ensure the release of Igboho from custody. The protesters started the demonstration from the residence of Igboho at the Soka area of Ibadan, Oyo state capital, and marched towards the toll gate on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Kareem Adesope, one of the protesters, called on Yoruba leaders and other Nigerians to prevail on the federal government to secure Igboho’s release. Adesope said the recent report that Igboho was sick should be a source of concern to all Nigerians, adding that he should not be allowed to die in detention. He said Igboho was innocent of the charges preferred against him and that he should not be treated like a criminal. According to him, Igboho’s fundamental human rights had been grossly abused. Igboho is currently in detention in Benin Republic over charges bordering on illegal entry, criminal association, among other alleged offences. On July 20, Igboho and Ropo, his wife, were arrested at an airport in Cotonou by Benin Republic’s security forces while he was trying to flee to Germany. He was detained at the request of the Nigerian government, who had declared him “wanted” after raiding his home in Ibadan, Oyo state. A week later, a Benin court blocked his extradition to Nigeria while ruling that he should be remanded in prison pending further hearing.
