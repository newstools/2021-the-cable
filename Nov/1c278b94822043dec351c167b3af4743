Chukwuma Soludo, candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the Anambra governorship election, has won the supplementary election in Ihiala LGA. The result was announced in the early hours of Wednesday. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had suspended the collation of the November 6 governorship election result after the election outcome from 20 of the 21 LGAs in the state were presented. Florence Obi, returning officer for the election, had also announced that a supplementary election would be held in Ihiala LGA, since election could not hold in the area on November 6. While presenting the results of the supplementary poll on Wednesday, the collation officer said there were challenges at two polling units where election officials couldn’t enter the communities as a result of “resistance”. Soludo secured 8,283 votes, followed by Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 2,485 votes. The Young Progressives Party (YPP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) trailed a long way behind with 344 and 343 votes, respectively. See the breakdown of the result below.
