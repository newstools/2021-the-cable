Air Peace says it will soon resume flight operations to Dubai in the coming weeks after the federal government relaxed restrictions on direct flights to and from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The airline disclosed this on Saturday in a statement posted on its Facebook page, titled ‘Air Peace latest update on Dubai flights’. According to the airline, more information concerning the service would be announced. “Air Peace is delighted to inform the flying public that it will be resuming its Dubai service via Sharjah in the coming weeks,” the airline said. “This is consequent upon the Federal Government’s lifting of the ban on flights from and to the UAE. “More updates will be provided via all our official communication channels as time goes on.” In March, flight operations between Nigeria and UAE were suspended over issues relating to the mandatory COVID-19 test before take-off. On Friday, after ten months of negotiations between both countries, Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, announced an end to the diplomatic row.
