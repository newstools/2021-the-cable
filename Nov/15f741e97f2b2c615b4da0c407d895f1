Ben Adaji, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has urged the inspector-general of police (IGP) to approve licences to responsible Nigerians to bear arms for self-defence. Speaking to journalists in Jalingo on Sunday, the APC chieftain said the situation in the county is worrisome and innocent Nigerians are living in perpetual fear of attack from bandits and kidnappers. He said due to the country’s population, it is almost impossible for security agents to offer protection to all Nigerians. Adaji also stated that some non-combatant tactics are essential to curb the rising security threat. “You will agree with me that because of the large population of Nigeria, it is not possible for security agencies to be in every home to provide security for Nigerians,” he said. “Therefore, it has become imperative for certain categories of Nigerians to be licensed to bear arms for self-protection.” Adaji also advised the military to take advantage of the recent court order which proscribed bandits declaring them as terrorists. A federal high court in Abuja had, on Thursday, declared the activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta’adda bandit groups as acts of terrorism. The judgment followed the motion ex-parte filed by Mohammed Abubakar, director of public prosecution (DPP) at the federal ministry of justice, who said President Muhammadu Buhari approved his action. The ruling by Taiwo Taiwo, the judge, specifically proscribed the activities of the “Yan Bindiga group” and the “Yan Ta’adda group” and other similar groups in any part of the country, especially in the north-west and the north-central as “acts of terrorism and illegality”.
