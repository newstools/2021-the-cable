Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, says a total of 3,906 inmates who escaped from different custodial centres in the country are still at large. Aregbesola spoke at a media briefing organised by the presidential media team at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Thursday. The minister said a total of 4,369 inmates escaped from different custodial centres from 2020 to date. He said out of that figure, 984 inmates have been recaptured. He said the biometrics of all custodial inmates in the country have been taken, adding that this will enable the escapees to be tracked and rearrested. “How long can they continue to run from the state? The state is a patient bird. You can run but you can never hide,” he said. “We have their biometrics. Whenever and wherever they appear to transact any business, their cover will be blown.” The minister also said 465 inmates are running various degree programmes around the country, adding that 85 of them are doing their postgraduate programmes. He said 560 inmates have been enrolled for WAEC/NECO examinations while 2,300 are enrolled for adult literacy classes in several custodial centers. In October, Abolongo Medium Custodial Centre in Oyo was attacked by gunmen who killed some security operatives and freed over 500 inmates.
