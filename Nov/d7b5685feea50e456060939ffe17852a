President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm Ayo Omotayo, a professor, as director-general of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru, Plateau state. Buhari’s request was in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the senate on Tuesday. The president based his request on section 5(2) of the NIPSS Act 2004. “In accordance with the provision of Section 5 subsection 2 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies Act 2004, I write to present for confirmation by the Senate, the appointment of Prof. Ayo C. Omotayo as Director-General, National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS),” the letter read. “The nominee’s CV is attached herewith. “It is my hope that the senate will consider and confirm the nominee in the usual expeditious manner.” The senate confirmed Abdulaziz Idris King and Mohammed Sani Baba as commissioners of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). The upper legislative chamber confirmed the nominees after Olubunmi Adetunmbi, chairman of the committee on national planning and economic affairs, presented a report. Adetunmbi said the nominees met the requirements expected of them to hold public office. They were confirmed after their nominations were put to voice votes.
