The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) says it has postponed the LG polls scheduled to hold on December 4 over lack of funds. Innocent Daniel, information officer of ADSIEC, made this known on Monday in Yola, the state capital. According to NAN, Daniel explained that the election was postponed indefinitely because the commission is still waiting for funds from the government. He also said the commission is experiencing difficulties with the voting points that were turned into new polling units by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), adding that the units have increased from 2,609 to 4,104. Daniel said the state electoral commission will require more ad-hoc staff and other voting equipment due to the rise in polling units. He added that the postponement will enable the government to source funds for the election. “This development will lead to an increase in facilities and ad hoc staff and the ongoing registration of new voters will have a resultant increase in ballot paper requirements,” he said. “It is in this regard that the preparations for the local government council election on Dec. 4, is hereby suspended to give government time to source for funds.”
