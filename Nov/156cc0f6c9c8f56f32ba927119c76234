The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) says it is disappointed over the removal of Nigeria from the list of countries blacklisted for “engaging in violation of religious freedom”. On Wednesday, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, announced 10 countries “of particular concern (CPC)”, with Nigeria missing from the list. In a statement on Thursday, Nadine Maenza, USCIRF chairperson, said she finds it unexplainable that the US department of state did not redesignate Nigeria as a country of concern. Apart from Nigeria, Maenza also expressed concern over the removal of India, Syria and Vietnam, adding that the department of state should reconsider designations based on facts presented by the commission. “USCIRF is disappointed that the State Department did not adopt our recommendations in designating the countries that are the worst violators of religious freedom,” the chairperson said. “While the State Department took steps forward on some designations, USCIRF is especially displeased with the removal of Nigeria from its CPC designation, where it was rightfully placed last year, as well as the omission of India, Syria, and Vietnam. “We urge the state department to reconsider its designations based on facts presented in its own reporting.” Nury Turkel, USCIRF vice-chairperson, said Russia’s designation as a country of concern is welcomed. “While USCIRF is concerned about the lack of designations for countries USCIRF recommended, Russia’s designation for the first time as a CPC for engaging in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom is welcomed,” Turkel said. “USCIRF has proposed this action since 2017. For years, USCIRF has raised the alarm regarding the Russian government’s purge of ‘non-traditional’ religions and religious freedom repression.” Meanwhile, the federal government has since welcomed the removal of Nigeria from the list, saying the present administration takes infringements seriously.
