The Borno government has distributed cash and food items to thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have shown interest in returning to their ancestral homes. Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, was at the Bakassi camp on Friday to coordinate the food and cash distribution. The Bakassi camp is an uncompleted government estate along Maiduguri-Dambia road where IDPs from Monguno, Gwoza, Guzamala and Marte LGAs had lived for seven years. According to the governor, his decision to visit the camp without prior notice is to discourage persons who infiltrate the camps when food items meant for IDPs are being distributed “Majority of the IDPs are willing to safely go back home. I came here in response to their request, to support them to relocate back to their ancestral homes. We are here to give them cash and food support that will help them with some small starting on livelihood after they return,” Zulum said. According to a statement by the Borno government, “of the N500 million shared during the Governor’s visit, each man and woman (mostly widows) heading a household received N100,000, two bags of 25kg rice, a carton of spaghetti and five litres of cooking oil”, while “married women received N50,000 cash each, even after their husbands each received N100,000 and food items listed above”. Zulum said the federal government, through the North East Development Commission (NEDC), provided the food items distributed among the IDPs. While commenting on government’s decision to close all camps in Maiduguri by December, he said “no IDP should be forced to relocate to any community”. He added that the government will support displaced persons who wish to remain in the town with means of livelihood. He expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, the ministry of humanitarian affairs, disaster management and social development and the NEDC for their support.
