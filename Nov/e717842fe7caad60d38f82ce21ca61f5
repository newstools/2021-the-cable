The Zamfara taskforce committee on insecurity, on Wednesday, ordered the closure of a filling station and bakery in Gusau and Tsafe LGAs of the state. Abubakar Dauran, chairman of the committee, gave the order shortly after security agencies arrested four suspects for alleged supplying bread and petrol to bandits. Dauran, who is also the special adviser on security matters to Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, said the filling station which is in Tsafe town would be closed for alleged selling petroleum products to bandits’ collaborators. He also said the bakery in Gusau would be shut down for allegedly supplying bread to bandits. “Both the filling station and bakery house will be closed down immediately,” he said. “Some of these suspects were found using jerrycans, gallons and generator tanks to buy petroleum from the filling stations and supplying the product to bandits in their hideouts. “They were arrested carrying petroleum heading to Yanware village of Tsafe LGA, while the suspected bread suppliers were caught illegally using motorcycles to supply bread to some unknown persons suspected to be bandits.” He expressed concern that in spite of the efforts by the governor to provide solutions to security challenges in the state, “some unpatriotic citizens are sabotaging the effort”. The committee chairman, however, appealed to residents to support government and security agencies with credible information on bandits and their collaborators for appropriate action.
