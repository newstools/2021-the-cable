Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL), the operator of Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos Terminal Two (MMA2), says there are no safety issues at its facility. The company was reacting to a picture of allegedly cracked pillars at the parking lot of the terminal. Mikail Mumuni, group corporate affairs manager of BASL, said in a statement on Sunday: “There are no cracked pillars at the parking lot. “The person who posted the picture is obviously not well informed. This is an expansion joint and not a crack.” The BASL spokesman said ”the expansion joint is a space provided in every substantial structure that enables the building or structure to breathe”. He said similar expansion joints are found on bridges across the country. “MMA2 carries out integrity tests regularly on its structure,” he added. “The tests have consistently shown that the structure is in good shape.”
