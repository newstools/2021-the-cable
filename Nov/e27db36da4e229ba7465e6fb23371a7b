One person has been reportedly killed in an attack on Gidan-Kwano, the host community of the Federal University of Technology (FUT), Minna, Niger state. Two persons were also kidnapped in the attack that occurred opposite the main gate of the university’s campus on Wednesday night. When contacted, Wasiu Abiodun, police public relations officer in Niger state, said two persons were abducted. “On 10/11/2021 at about 2330hrs, some suspected hoodlums attacked a shop at Gidan-Kwano opposite FUT Gate and abducted two children of the shop owner,” he said. “Police/vigilante were immediately drafted to the scene for aggressive manhunt of the hoodlums and during stop and search, one of the suspects was intercepted and arrested at Barkuta village.” Abiodun told TheCable that investigation is ongoing to rescue the victims. The north-central state has seen a surge in the activities of gunmen in recent weeks. In October, some worshippers were killed when gunmen invaded a mosque at Mazukaka village in Mashegu LGA of the state.
