The Yobe government says it will deduct 10 percent of basic salaries of civil servants for November as their contributions to improving the education sector in the state. Muhammad Lamin, the commissioner for home affairs, information and culture, disclosed this on Monday at a media briefing in Damaturu, the Yobe capital. According to NAN, Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe, had on November 9 inaugurated a 21-member committee to mobilise funds for the education sector. Buni had also declared a state of emergency on the education sector. Speaking on Monday, Lamin said insurgency had impacted negatively on the lives of the citizenry, as well as the education system in the state. “Apart from reaching out to people outside government, we feel that civil servants in the state should also give their modest contribution to the programme, by contributing 10 percent of their November basic salaries,” he said. “By this briefing therefore, civil servants are informed that the deduction will be for only the month of November 2021. “In this regard, government is appealing to civil servants in the state to heartily support government in her bid to rescue our state from the catastrophe of educational decay.”
