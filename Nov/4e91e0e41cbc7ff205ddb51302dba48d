Two police officers have been reportedly killed following an attack by gunmen in Anambra state. In a statement on Sunday, Ikenga Tochukwu, Anambra command spokesperson, said the slain officers were travelling with their colleagues when they were ambushed by the gunmen. He said the bodies of the slain officers were burnt by the gunmen, while one officer is still missing. According to him, other officers were able to fight their way out of the ambush and rescue two civilian drivers travelling with them. “In the attack, two police officers were killed and their bodies were burnt while one of the officers is still missing,” Tochukwu said. In September, three police officers were killed by gunmen in the state, while two other officers were said to have been injured during the shooting incident at a security post mounted by the police operatives. A month after, gunmen set ablaze the Ajali divisional police headquarters in Orumba north LGA of the state. Some police officers sustained gunshot wounds during the attack. An operational base of the Department of State Services (DSS) in Nnewi area of the state was also set ablaze by gunmen in October.
