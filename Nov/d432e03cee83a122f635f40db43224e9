Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), says the federal government has not ruled out all possibilities in resolving cases concerning leaders of secessionist groups in some parts of the country. The federal government is in an ongoing legal battle against Nnamdi Kanu, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, who it charged with a seven-count offence bordering on treasonable felony and terrorism. In a similar development, authorities are actively working on extraditing Sunday Igboho, ‘Yoruba Nation’ agitator, from Benin Republic to face criminal charges. However, in a chat with Arise TV on Wednesday, Malami said though these individuals’ actions have “criminal undertones”, the federal government will not strike out other means of resolving the cases. “As far as the security situation is concerned, and as far as governance and this administration is concerned, you cannot rule out all possibilities. But crime is a crime, and there are criminal undertones. And when you’re associated with certain conducts, you cannot rule out the government’s right to take steps,” the AGF said. “Generally speaking, that’s why I say no possibility is out ruled but, then, there has to be an approach for government to consider,” “So I cannot be preemptive in telling you that clearly and outrightly that reconciliation, perhaps, is being considered. “We will look into it (approach) for the purpose of looking at its weight, the authenticity of it, the good faith associated with it and then bring about the considerable factors relating to the negotiations or otherwise. “So, it is not a conclusion that one can outrightly make without juxtaposing associated facts relating to the reconciliation; there has to be an approach and then a counter consideration.”
