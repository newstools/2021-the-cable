President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigerians would be able to “look after themselves” when adequate infrastructure is available in the country. According to a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, Buhari said this on Thursday during his meeting with Mohammed Al-Jasser, the president of Islamic Development Bank (IDB), at the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum in France. Buhari said his administration remains committed to contributing significantly to infrastructural development in Nigeria. “We are struggling very hard on infrastructure because there can’t be sustainable development without it,” Buhari was quoted as saying. “Considering the vastness of our country, we need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years. And our people are seeing the new developments. “Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly. When infrastructure is in place, our people can look after themselves.” The president thanked the IDB for its support so far, but expressed concern about challenges in Nigeria, saying “what we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy”. “It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you,” he added. In his remarks, Al-Jasser said he was glad to see the level of collaboration between Nigeria and the IDB since he assumed office three months ago. “I am impressed by your policies on infrastructure, which will give opportunities to youths, and encourage the private sector,” Al-Jasser told Buhari. “Nigeria is a pivotal country to us, and it deserves all the help it can get.” The IDB boss said the main role of the bank is to promote development among its stakeholders, adding that the bank would continue to support Nigeria.
