Over the weekend, multiple reports on social media and blogs claimed that the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has reinstated Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police. The viral post also claimed that Kyari has been cleared of all allegations levelled against him by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the fraud involving Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster. Some of the reports further claimed that Kyari has been deployed to Anambra state for the November 6 governorship election as his first assignment after the suspension was allegedly lifted. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623769" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="986" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005.jpeg 714w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005-167x300.jpeg 167w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005-571x1024.jpeg 571w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005-13x24.jpeg 13w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005-20x36.jpeg 20w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0005-27x48.jpeg 27w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> On Twitter, a verified account with the handle — Gold Myne TV — with about 44,000 followers shared the post alongside a picture claiming that the “reinstatement” of Kyari has generated “wild jubilations”. “Wild jubilations as police hierarchy gives suspended DCP & Hushpuppi Associate Abba Kyari, the greenlight to resume duty as an officer,” the post claimed. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623771" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="1253" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006.jpeg 562w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006-132x300.jpeg 132w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006-450x1024.jpeg 450w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006-11x24.jpeg 11w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006-16x36.jpeg 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-20211101-WA0006-21x48.jpeg 21w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> The post was shared on Saturday and as of the time of filing this report, it had generated over 335 retweets, 143 likes and 82 comments. A Facebook post by One Maria Nwachi Nigeria Police has allegedly Recalled Supercop, DCP Abba Kyari, after Months of Suspension. He is to be Posted to Anambra State As He Resumes Work.@FBI Is the man below above the law? #FreeMaziNnamdiKanunow pic.twitter.com/D7hDspTAUH — #Ikonso #IkonsoInMillions #ESNForever (@kalu_philly) October 30, 2021  BACKGROUND In July, FBI revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with Hushpuppi to jail one of the latter’s associates after a dispute over a $1.1 million scam on Qatari businesspeople. The FBI also alleged that the embattled social media celebrity sent money to the crack investigators via a third person bank account and hosted Kyari in his Dubai apartment. Following the allegations, the top detective was suspended and a panel was set up by the inspector-general of police to probe the FBI allegations. But Kyari denied the allegations, claiming that his “hands are clean”. The issue has fueled several misleading contents in the public space, some of which have been fact-checked by TheCable here and here. VERIFICATION To verify the claim, TheCable subjected the picture used to support the claim to reverse image search on multiple search engines. In the picture, Kyari was being lifted up by some men in what appears to be a celebratory mood. The earliest version of the picture according to the image search was posted on a news website on June 12, 2017 In the article, Kyari was praised for his heroic act in the arrest of Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, a suspected kidnap kingpin better known as Evans. It also added that the “super cop” was lifted up by his colleagues in celebration of Evans’ arrest. Also, a review of online reports showed that no credible media platforms published the report that Kyari has been asked to resume work. However, Punch newspaper, in a report, said police sources have confirmed that Kyari is still on suspension. In other words, there is no evidence in public that the suspension slammed on Kyari has been lifted. TheCable reached out to Frank Mba, police spokesperson, for comments but he did not respond to his calls or reply to text messages. VERDICT There is no sufficient evidence to back the claim that the police authorities have reinstated Kayri. Hence, the claim that the suspension has been lifted is misleading.
