Work and Play, the foremost Nigerian motorsport organiser, is set to launch the first local streetcar racing app. Ade Ojuoko, founder of the group, who announced the development on Tuesday, said the app will be hosted on both iOS and android platforms. This initiative, according to Ojuoko, is aimed to help the youth in Nigeria to get involved in sports gaming which is “arguably the most rewarding sport at the moment.” He also said that the gaming application was necessitated by the need to offer opportunities to motorsports in particular and sports in general. “The Nigeria motorsports community has lots of potential and as the events grow in recognition, we want to help people to experience what the sport offers,” Ojuoko said. “The App is intended to engage the racers and enthusiasts during events and to generate engagement for new demographics that are hampered from being part of live motorsports competitions. “Our proven records of support for live shows has exposed us to other grounds for development which we believe this App will help us to plug.” The app will be unveiled on November 26 during the Nigeria Tourism Week at a ceremony scheduled for the MUSON Centre, Lagos. At the event, there would be a live demonstration of the software features while the narratives would be explained by the Work and Play group and the software designers.
