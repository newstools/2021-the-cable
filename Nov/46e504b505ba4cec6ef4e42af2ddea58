Lagos State Government has unveiled plans to deliver 50 megawatts of electricity for 20 hours daily to residents through the Lagos State Electricity Policy. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, made the disclosed in a statement released by Kayode Oyekanmi, director of public affairs, ministry of commerce, industry, and cooperatives (MCIC), on Saturday. According to the statement, Sanwo-Olu said the framework is a sub-national electricity sector entirely off the national grid to cater solely to the needs of the state’s households. He charged the state’s residents to “maximise the opportunities at our disposal,” while adding that “the society expects more from you in terms of innovation and creativity that will put an end to the challenges of industrialisation in Africa.” “It is time to think outside the box. You can, for instance, begin to think of developing machines that refine raw materials in small qualities to start with, but run solely on solar or other forms of clean energy,” the governor said. “It is not the time to think of things we don’t have. Rather, it is the time to maximise the opportunities at our disposal. “I want you to know that we, the society, expect more from you in terms of innovation and creativity that will put an end to the challenges of industrialisation in Africa.”
