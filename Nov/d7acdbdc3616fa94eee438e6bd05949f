The Lagos police command’s criminal investigation department in Panti says it has arrested 12 suspects in connection with the murder of Kazeem Abonde, a chief superintendent of police (CSP). Abonde was killed on September 23 during a raid on criminal hideouts at Ajao estate, Lagos. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by Adekunle Ajisebutu, Lagos command spokesperson, the suspects were arrested after investigation. “Arrest of one Ismaila Abdullahi Haruna, aged 23 years, and 11 other suspects was made possible as a result of a four-week intensive but diligent investigation carried out by crack detectives of the Command,” the statement reads. “The suspects, who confessed to the crimes of conspiracy, murder, attempted murder and willful damage were arrested in their criminal hideouts in Lagos and Nasarawa States where they were hibernating to evade arrest after the dastardly act. “During interrogation, the suspects gave a blow-by-blow account of how the brutal attack on the deceased police officer and other injured police officers was carried out and the criminal roles each played. “Their arrest was facilitated by credible, actionable intelligence.” Ajisebutu added that all the suspects will be arraigned at the Yaba magistrates’ court on Wednesday. He also said the Lagos police commissioner thanked the Abonde family and the public for their “patience, understanding and support”, adding that the command will “ensure diligent prosecution of the case”. “The police, therefore, seek further cooperation of members of the public, particularly the Command’s strategic partners, by giving additional information that could lead to the arrest of other suspects still at large,” Ajisebutu added.
