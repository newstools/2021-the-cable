Odion Ighalo and John Noble have arrived at the Super Eagles camp ahead of their 2022 World Cup qualification match against Liberia on Saturday. The duo’s arrival takes the number of players at the Tangier camp to 24 — the total number of invitees by Gernot Rohr. Ighalo, who had announced his retirement in 2019, was surprisingly recalled to the Eagles squad by Rohr despite criticism. The coach had hailed the 32-year-old as “a special player” whose experience and maturity would be of “great” benefits to the younger players. Noble was a last-minute replacement for Francis Uzoho, who was ruled out of the team after falling ill. The Enyimba goalkeeper will be hoping to get his first appearance for the Eagles against the Lone Stars. Ahmed Musa, the team’s captain, had earlier said that the Eagles would be going for all three points against their West African neighbours. He also added that the Gernot Rohr-led boys recognise the fixture’s importance and can’t afford to lose the game. “We know the importance of the game. We can’t afford to lose. We have to go for the three points. At the end of the game on Saturday, we hope to celebrate another important win,” Musa said. The Super Eagles defeated Liberia 2-0 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in September. The reverse clash will be held at the Stade Grande de Tangier at 6 pm on Saturday. The Eagles sit atop group C with just two points above Cape Verde, who placed second with seven points after four rounds of games.
