The Nigeria Union of Railway Workers (NURW) says it will continue its strike until it receives positive feedback from the federal government. Innocent Ajiji, president of the union, said this on Friday in an interview with NAN in Lagos. The union had declared a three-day warning strike, which began on Thursday. The railway workers are protesting over “low wages and salaries”. Speaking on the development, Ajiji said the workers are willing to enter negotiations with the management of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC). He, however, added that if nothing promising comes from discussions with the government, the union may have to embark on an indefinite strike. “If nothing positive comes out, we will have to complete our three-day warning strike. And after the warning strike, we will give the management time to see what it will do about our demands,” he said. “If the time we gave to government lapses without them doing anything, then we will embark on total strike.” Some other demands of the railway workers include payment of promotion arrears for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 for NRC workers, as well as payment of “skipped” monthly salaries of some workers, especially those who employed in 2019. Meanwhile, in a notice posted on its website, the NRC announced the suspension of purchase of tickets pending when the strike will be called off. “Dear Esteemed Passengers, following the proposed labour action, NRC has temporarily suspended ticket purchase from Thursday 18th November 2021,” the notice reads. “Kindly bear with us as we anticipate expedited resolution. We look forward to welcoming you back on our service as soon as possible.”
