Chelsea, the English Premier League (EPL) leaders, were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by Burnley in their league clash at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Kai Havertz gave the Londoners the lead that was cancelled out by Matej Vydra late in the second period to halt Chelsea’s four-match winning streak in the league. Havertz, the German international forward, headed home a Reece Jams cross on 33 minutes as the blues went into the interval ahead. Thomas Tuchel’s side could have scored more, hitting the post and the goalkeeper in inspired form. They were made to regret those chances 11 minutes from time as Vydra stabbed home a knock-on from Jay Rodriguez to ensure the third match unbeaten league streak. Chelsea stay top with 26 points from 11 matches, three ahead of Manchester City who consigned Manchester United, their neighbours, to a 2-0 loss earlier in the day at Old Trafford. Man City, occupying the blue side of Manchester, claimed bragging rights, thanks to a disorganized United defence that allowed two first-half goals. The five-man defence gifted City an own goal courtesy of Eric Bailey. Bernardo Silva nicked in at the far post to seal the victory. Pep Guardiola’s team could have had a couple more against a very ordinary United side that was bailed out by David De Gea, their goalkeeper, on countless occasions. RESULTS
