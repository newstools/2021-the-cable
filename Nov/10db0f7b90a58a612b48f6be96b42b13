The Niger government says it spent N605 million on internally displaced persons (IDPs) within the last two years. Ahmed Matane, secretary to the state government, disclosed this on Tuesday at a media briefing in Minna, the Niger capital. According to NAN, Matane said the funding for IDPs was as a result of insecurity and flooding, adding that the state government also purchased over 100 patrol vehicles fitted with communication gadgets for security agencies within the period. He also said over N5 billion was spent on general security in the state, adding that the expended amount was to provide support in the fight against banditry and related vices. “We have also refurbished 77 Hilux police patrol vehicles along with communication gadgets and five armoured personnel carriers (APCs) for the ongoing fight against banditry and kidnapping,” he said. “We have constantly been paying allowances to security personnel deployed to fight criminal elements. “We have devised new security strategies to fight banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other criminal elements in the state.” He assured the citizens that the government remains committed to curtailing insecurity. “We will not relent in the effort to protect the lives and properties of our people through well-coordinated approaches towards tackling any form of insecurity,” he said. “We will enhance community policing to enable the residents volunteer information that could aid in apprehending miscreants.” He also urged members of the public to support the security agencies with useful information on curbing criminal activities in the state.
