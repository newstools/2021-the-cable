Many people are feared dead after a petrol-laden tanker exploded around Oju Irin in Lafenwa area of Abeokuta, Ogun state. TheCable learnt that the explosion occurred on Sunday morning. An unconfirmed number of persons were affected by the inferno, including shops and buildings around the axis. Babatunde Akinbiyi, the spokesperson, Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), confirmed the incident. Akinbiyi said the tanker exploded owing to the uncooperative attitude of people around the axis, who he said were scooping petrol, which sparked the fire. He said the tanker, owing to an axle problem, overturned around 4:45am while making its way inbound Rounder from Oju-Irin, Lafenwa, causing it to spill its content on the road. He asked residents to vacate the vicinity, saying TRACE, police, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the Fire Service are on the ground to bring the situation under control. “Moreover, the motoring public going inward Rounder axis from Lafenwa, should use Olomore and Oke-Ata axis respectively as alternative routes, since traffic has been diverted away from the area of incident,” he added. The spokesperson said further information will be provided to the media as soon as possible. Ahmed Umar, the FRSC sector commander in the state, also confirmed the incident, saying officers of the command are around to control traffic.
