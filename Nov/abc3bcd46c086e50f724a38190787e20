Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, says the federal government is committed to ending banditry in the country. Malami said this in reaction to a court judgment proscribing bandit groups in the nation. Following an ex-parte motion filed by the federal government through Mohammed Abubakar, director of public prosecution (DPP) at the federal ministry of justice, Taiwo Taiwo, a federal high court judge, had on Thursday made an order declaring the activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta’adda bandit groups as acts of terrorism. The court also proscribed the activities of other similar groups in any part of Nigeria, “either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called”. In a statement on Friday, the minister through his spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, said the court judgment shows that the federal government is taking the necessary steps to end banditry in the country. “The development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatists’ organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country,” he said. “By this declaration, the federal government of Nigeria has taken bold steps to deal ruthlessly with all terrorist groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring a lasting solution to the myriad of insecurity challenges in the country. “The office of the attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice in collaboration with relevant government agencies, including security operatives, are working assiduously to do the needful to take full advantage of this declaration. “The government will gazette, publish the publicise the proscription order.”
