The Adamawa State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) says 10 staff of the local education authority (LEA) have been arrested for allegedly diverting school bags donated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Salihi Ateequ, SUBEB chairman, disclosed this on Wednesday at a media briefing in Yola, the Adamawa capital. According to NAN, Joel Isiah, UNICEF’s education officer in Adamawa, had recently raised the alarm over diversion of learning materials donated to schools in the state. Isiah had described the action as “sabotage”. Speaking on the development, Ateequ said the board will ensure that all officials involved in the sale of the bags are brought to book. He also said efforts are being made to apprehend more suspects in connection with diversion of the bags. “A high-level committee was constituted and the committee has done its job very well,” the SUBEB chairman said. “Arrests in respect of the sale of the UNICEF school bags have been made in Michika, Mubi south, Hong, and Yola north local government areas of the state. “Ten suspects were found wanting and had been charged to court.” According to him, the arrest will serve as a deterrent to others against diversion of school bags and learning materials donated by the UN agency.
