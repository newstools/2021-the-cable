An Ikeja special offences court has granted permission to two witnesses who do not want to appear in court to testify against Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, suspected kidnap kingpin better known as Evans, to testify virtually. Oluwatoyin Taiwo, presiding judge, gave the ruling on Monday after S.O. Fashola, state prosecutor, moved an application asking that the evidence of the two prosecution witnesses be heard in court via audio-visual means. “This court is satisfied that the prosecution has given cogent reasons why section 210 of the Evidence Act 2011 and section 200(2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law as amended should avail the prosecution,” the judge ruled. “It is stated on the affidavit that the witnesses are concerned for their lives and that of their families and they now live outside the jurisdiction of the court. “In the light of this and in the interest of justice and expedite action, I hereby grant the application as prayed. “The case is adjourned to December 17 for hearing. The prosecution should ensure that necessary arrangements are made.” Evans is standing trial alongside Victor Aduba, a dismissed soldier. They are answering to a four-count charge of kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms. The prosecution accused Evans and the discharged soldier of kidnapping  Sylvanus Ahamonu, holding him hostage for at least nine weeks, and demanding a ransom of $420,000 from his family.
