The Imo government says it will launch a security outfit in the state on November 30. Briefing journalists after the state executive council meeting in Owerri on Wednesday, Declan Emelumba, commissioner for information and strategy, said the new security outfit would be a combination of vigilante and community policing models. Emelumba noted that although it is an extra expenditure for the state, it has become necessary to address the security challenges in Imo, adding that the council saw reasons to seek approval for more security funding from the house of assembly. “The launch has become necessary to check further insecurity and make the yuletide celebrations comfortable for Imo people both at home and in the diaspora,” he said. “Council regrets that money which government would have used to attend to more development-oriented matters in the state is diverted to security matters. “This is the opportunity cost of insecurity to the people of Imo which everyone must rise to condemn and assist to contain.” In recent months, Imo has seen a surge in the activities of gunmen, leading to killing of residents and security operatives. Also, facilities such as correctional centres, police stations, offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), among others, have also be attacked by gunmen in the state.
