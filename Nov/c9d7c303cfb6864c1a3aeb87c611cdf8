Two persons killed while 15 others sustained injuries on Saturday when a DAF truck overturned at a diversion point on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The vehicle, which was travelling towards Lagos, was loaded with bags of onions and passengers when the incident occurred. The accident occurred around 6.30 am and led to gridlock as the truck emptied the onions on the road. Babatunde Akinbiyi, public relations officer of Ogun state traffic compliance and enforcement corps, confirmed the incident. “According to an eyewitness account, the vehicle was approaching the diversion when the driver lost control, probably as a result of over speeding. “It overturned in the process, spilling the onions it was carrying on the road, together with the 17 passengers atop the truck. “Two of the passengers died on the spot while 15 others were injured.” Akinbiyi commiserated with the families of the deceased. He also warned drivers to reduce their speed while approaching diversions and construction zones and be mindful of the attendant consequences of overspeeding.
