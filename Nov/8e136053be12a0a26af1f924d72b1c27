Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles captain, says the team will be going for all three points in their 2022 World Cup qualification encounter against Liberia on Saturday. Musa spoke with the Eagles media team on Wednesday evening — after their training session in Tangier, Morocco. He said while the squad awaits the arrival of Odion Ighalo and John Noble, the camp is bubbly and ready for the game. The 28-year-old forward, who recently became the most-capped Eagles player, added that the Gernot Rohr-led boys recognise the importance of the fixture and can’t afford to lose the game. “As you can see everyone is happy and we are ready for the game. We have 22 players here. Tomorrow we are expecting the goalkeeper (John Noble) and Odion Ighalo,” Musa said. “We know the importance of the game, we can’t afford to lose. We have to go for the three points. At the end of the game on Saturday we hope to celebrate another important win.” The Super Eagles defeated Liberia 2-0 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in September. The reverse clash will be held at the Stade Grande de Tangier at 6 pm on Saturday. The Eagles sit atop group C with just two points above Cape Verde who placed second with seven points after four rounds of games.
