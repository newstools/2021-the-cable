Raising New Voices, a non-profit organisation, has trained 30 youths on leadership across all the LGAs in Osun state. Raising New Voices Fellowship is a leadership training initiative with the target of raising 774 leaders in each LGA in the country. The programme which began in March, was concluded on November 13 with the presentation of certificates to participants. Jude Feranmi, convener of the group, said the objective of the Raising New Voices Fellowship is to equip youths with the knowledge needed to excel in positions of leadership. “The idea is to raise at least a leader in each of the 774 local government areas of the country. These will be agents of transforming Nigeria into what we all desire,” he said. “We started this year with support from Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Foundation in Germany and we have been able to complete this programme for these fellows this year.” Victor Terhemba, director of communications, said 10 participants of the programme graduated in 2020, while 20 were youths were trained in 2021. Ismail Omipidan, chief press secretary to Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun state, asked youths to participate actively in politics, adding that they are needed to drive a change in the system. “We must divert more of our efforts into participation in real politics instead of social media. Many youths spend too much time on social media than participation in politics,” he said. “Only a few persons can be appointed without being a member of any political party, while no one can be elected without being a card-carrying member of a political party. Unless things change. He added that “lobbying doesn’t necessarily mean you give people money, engagement is also important”.
