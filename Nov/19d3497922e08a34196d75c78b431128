Lucky Igbinedion, a former governor of Edo state, has been invited by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations bordering on fraud. Igbinedion was said to have arrived the EFCC headquarters in Abuja on Thursday afternoon. He is reportedly being questioned over alleged diversion of public funds amounting to N1.6 billion. As of Thursday midnight, the former governor was said to still be in EFCC custody. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesman, who confirmed that Igbinedion was in the custody of the agency, didn’t give further details on why the former governor was invited. Igbinedion served as governor of Edo from 1999 to 2007. However, not long after he left office, he was prosecuted by the EFCC over allegations of corruption. In December 2008, a federal high court in Enugu fined the former Edo governor a sum of N3.5 million in a N25 billion financial fraud case. The former governor, who pleaded guilty to the charges, agreed to pay the fine as an alternative to spending six months in jail. Igbinedion was also to refund about N500 million and forfeit three properties, including one in Abuja. Although full details of the new investigation by the EFCC are not yet clear, according to NAN, the former governor is said to be answering questions in the light of fresh evidence against him over alleged diversion of a loan obtained by the state during his tenure.
