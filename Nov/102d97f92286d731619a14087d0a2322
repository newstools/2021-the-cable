D’Tigers on Sunday defeated Uganda 95-69 in the 2023 FIBA World Cup qualifiers. The Nigerians had to turn around their fortunes in the first round of the qualifiers, which was played in Angola, after suffering a shocking loss to Cape Verde in the opener. They had to dig deep in the second game to record a slim victory over Mali. However, it was a lot easier in their third game as they trounced Uganda by a 26-point margin to complete the comeback and top the group. The match, which took place on Sunday at the Pavilhão Multiusos Acácias Rubras, saw D’Tigers start as the hungrier side right from the tip-off. The Nigerians took the first quarter 25-18 before continuing their domination in the successive quarter to finish with a 53-37 lead at halftime. The high-flying intensity of D’Tigers suffered a slump in the third quarter, but they still managed to extend their lead to 63-45. The final quarter was an end-to-end affair but Nigeria maintained the momentum and finished 95-69. Ike Diogu led D’Tigers with 27 points, 10 rebounds, and two assists, followed by Omotayo Ogundiran, who netted 11 points and four assists. D’Tigers sit atop Group A with five points from three games and will hope to continue their resurgence when the reverse fixtures resume next year. The top three teams from each group will advance to the final round of qualifiers. Only five African teams will earn a spot at the FIBA Basketball World Cup that is scheduled to take place from August 25 to September 10, 2023, in Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
