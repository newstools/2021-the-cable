Aminata Diallo, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) women’s midfielder, has been arrested as part of an investigation into an attack on one of her teammates. Aminata, 26, was apprehended by the Versailles Regional Police Service on Wednesday for allegedly being involved in the assault of Kheira Hamraoui, who was assaulted by two masked men last week. The club confirmed the arrest in a statement released on its official website on Wednesday. The French giants also condemned the attack, adding that it would cooperate with police in its investigation. “Paris Saint-Germain can confirm that Aminata Diallo was taken into custody this morning by the Versailles Regional Police Service as part of the proceedings opened following an attack on the Club’s players last Thursday evening,” the statement read. “Paris Saint-Germain condemns in the strongest possible terms the violence committed. Kheira Hamraoui joined PSG from Barcelona in July “Since Thursday evening, the Club has taken all necessary measures to guarantee the health, well-being and safety of its entire women’s team. “Paris Saint-Germain is working with the Versailles Police to clarify the facts. The Club is paying close attention to the progress of the proceedings and will study what action to take.” The attack occurred on November 4 after Diallo drove Hamraoui home from a restaurant where the players had eaten. The two masked men — armed with iron bars — were then said to have dragged Hamraoui out of the car and hit her in the legs for a few minutes before they fled. Diallo and Hamraoui, who are also international teammates for France, both play in midfield and are in direct competition with each other. It was alleged that Diallo organised the attack to put her teammate out of action.
