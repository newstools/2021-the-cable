Liverpool produced a sensational performance to defeat resurgent Arsenal 4-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield on Saturday. Liverpool frontline of Sadio Mane, Diogo Jota, and Mohamed Salah all scored to send Jurgen Klopp’s men into a big lead while Takumi Minamino added the fourth minutes after entering as a substitute. The well-deserved win for Liverpool halted Arsenal’s eight-game winning run in the league as the Reds also stopped their own mini-slump, securing their first league win in three matches. Liverpool rose to second on the EPL log on 25 points, four behind leaders Chelsea who won 3-0 at Leicester City in the early kick-off of the day. Manchester United, however, continued their abject displays and poor form, succumbing to a shambolic and depressing 4-1 loss at Watford. Emmanuel Dennis, Super Eagles of Nigeria striker, scored the final goal and supplied an assist — his fifth of the season — as Watford earned a dominant win over Manchester United to rise to 16th on the EPL table while the Red Devils slumped to seventh.
