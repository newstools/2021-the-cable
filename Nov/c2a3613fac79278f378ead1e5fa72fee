Bayan-Men, identified as a militant group, has reportedly blown up an oil facility belonging to the Nigeria Agip Oil Company in Ogba-Egbema-Ndoni LGA of Rivers state. The militants reportedly attacked the Onosi-Ogu manifold facility at Obosi area of Omoku in Egbema-Ndoni LGA on Wednesday. According to Punch, the development comes about two days after an oil facility operated by the company was attacked by the militants. The militants were said to have claimed responsibly for the attack in a statement issued on Wednesday. General Agaba, identified as the spokesperson for Bayan-Men, said the company has seven days to meet the demands of the host community or face more attacks on its facilities. “The action we carried out is as a result of Agip’s failure to comply with the 24 hours ultimatum we handed to them to engage our people on how to commence dealing directly with individual communities order than through individuals,” the statement reads. “We are not criminals; we are intellectuals. The fact is that when a man is pushed to the wall, he bounces back with double force. We are giving Agip another seven days to open windows of negotiation with the 27 communities of Omoku clan.” When contacted, Nnamdi Omoni, police spokesperson in Rivers state, said he is yet to confirm the fresh attack. Omoni told TheCable that details of the attack would be made public when the command confirms the development.
