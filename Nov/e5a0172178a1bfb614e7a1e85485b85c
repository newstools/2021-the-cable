Xavi Hernandez is set to become the new coach of Barcelona after an agreement between the Spanish giants and Al Sadd FC was reached over the termination of his contract as Qatar-based club’s manager. According to Guardian UK, the Qatari club broke the news in a statement released on Friday. The club announced a deal has been “agreed on Xavi’s move to Barcelona after the payment of the release clause stipulated in the contract.” Turki Al-Ali, Al-Sadd’s chief executive, said the Barcelona icon had informed the club of his interest to return to the Camp Nou a couple of days ago to fix “the critical stage his hometown club is going through.” “Xavi informed us a few days ago of his desire to go to Barcelona at this particular time, because of the critical stage his hometown club is going through, and we understand this and decided not to stand in his way,” Al-Ali was quoted as saying. Barcelona are ninth in La Liga and recently dismissed Ronald Koeman after just four months in charge of the club. Sergi Barjuan was appointed as an interim manager, overseeing a draw at home to Alavés and a win at Dynamo Kyiv that left the team second in their Champions League group. It is understood that Barjuan will take charge at Celta Vigo on Saturday before handing over to Xavi. Xavi left Barcelona in 2015 after helping the club win 25 trophies, including four Champions Leagues and eight La Liga titles, in 17 seasons.
