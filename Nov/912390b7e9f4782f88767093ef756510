The United States says it is looking forward to the “suitable measures” the federal government will take on allegations of abuses against some security agents indicted in the Lagos #EndSARS panel report. On October 19, 2020, as part of recommendations put forward during the #EndSARS protests, the Lagos government inaugurated the judicial panel to investigate petitions on police brutality in the state. TheCable had reported that the Lagos judicial panel submitted its report to the state government on Monday. In the final report, the panel had said the protesters who were shot at the Lekki tollgate were killed in a manner that could be described in the context of a “massacre”. According to the report, nine #EndSARS protesters were killed, while security operatives at the scene were said to have prevented ambulances from reaching injured demonstrators. Reacting in a statement on Tuesday, the US said it “welcomed the conclusion of the panel’s report” and is looking forward to the actions the government would take. “We look forward to the Lagos State government’s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020,” the statement reads. “Those events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and federal governments taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.”
