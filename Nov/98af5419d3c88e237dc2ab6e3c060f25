Several passengers were burnt to death in an accident that occurred on the Ore-Okitipupa axis of Ondo state on Friday. Five other passengers sustained varying degrees of injuries. According to NAN, the accident occurred after a head-on collision involving a white Toyota Coaster bus and a white Ford J5 bus. An eyewitness told NAN that passengers in the Toyota bus appeared to be on their way from a function and were returning to Akure, the Ondo capital. The eyewitness said no fewer than 10 people died in the accident, adding that the Ford bus was loaded with “tanks of local gin”. Both buses were said to be attempting to maneuver a bad portion of the road, when they collided. The local gin in the Ford bus was said to have contributed to the fire, which occurred after the head-on collision. Following the accident, there was a traffic gridlock in the area for more than one hour. Sikiru Alonge, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) commander, Ore unit, confirmed the accident, but said the number of dead bodies could not be yet be ascertained. He, however, said the five persons who sustained injuries were rescued and had been taken to the State Specialist Hospital in Okitipupa and Prima Hospital in Ore — both in Ondo state. Alonge said joint efforts by the FRSC, police and army helped to put out the fire, clear the debris and evacuate the burnt bodies from the accident site. The FRSC commander also advised motorists and other road users to avoid over-speeding on the highway.
