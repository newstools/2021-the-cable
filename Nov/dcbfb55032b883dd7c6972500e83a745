The police have arrested 14 persons in connection with the raid on the home of Mary Odili, a justice of the supreme court. During a briefing on Thursday, Frank Mba, force public relations officer, said the suspects include a fake chief superintendent of police (CSP), a journalist, and an Islamic scholar. Mba said 10 other suspects, including two military personnel, are currently at large. “The inspector-general of police (IGP) ordered a comprehensive investigation into the incident,” he said. “Earlier on, the attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and minister of justice had also submitted a written petition into the office of the IGP, requesting a robust and discreet investigation into the matter, with the aim of unravelling the identities of the persons involved, their motives, and perhaps, the authorities, if any, behind them. “The case was subsequently handed over to the force intelligence bureau on the instruction of the IGP.” On October 30, security operatives — made up of soldiers and police officers — stormed the Abuja residence of the supreme court justice over an allegation that illegal activities were going on there. The search warrant was granted to one Lawrence Ajodo — identified as a chief superintendent of police — who is now said to be an impostor. Documents seen by TheCable had revealed that the warrant presented by security operatives to search Odili’s residence bore a wrong address. Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and minister of justice; and Abdulrasheed Bawa, EFCC chairman, had denied authorising the search. A magistrate court in Abuja had also revoked the warrant presented by security operatives to search the house. Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), had subsequently ordered an investigation into the incident.
