The Enugu police say it arrested Onyishi Chidi for the alleged disappearance and murder of his seven-year-old son. Daniel Ndukwe, the state police spokesman, in a statement, alleged that the victim was used for money ritual. He said the minor was earlier reported missing on October 22 and that following receipt of information on the search for the missing child, the police arrested his father on Saturday at Coal Camp, Enugu. He added that Chidi was arrested, alongside a pastor for allegedly being responsible for the disappearance and murder of the victim. “Chidi confessed to the crime and led police operatives to arrest a blind Pastor Okeke Eneokwor (95), whom he fingered as an accomplice,” he said. “He also led police operatives and a medical team to a stream at Abakpa-Nike, Enugu, where the decomposing corpse of the minor was exhumed from a shallow grave.” Ndukwe said Lawal Abubakar, the commissioner of police, had also ordered a thorough and conclusive investigation of the matter. “The commissioner also directed the State Criminal Investigation Department to expedite action on the investigation to ensure the prosecution of everyone found culpable in the act,’’ he added. He also called on residents of the state to remain vigilant, law-abiding and to promptly report criminals activities to the nearest police station.
