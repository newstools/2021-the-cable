Hakeem Odumosu, Lagos state commissioner of police, says the police stations burnt during #EndSARS protests are undergoing renovation. In October 2020, Nigerians took to the streets in some parts of the country, including Lagos, to protest against the now-disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian Police Force. The #EndSARS protest in Lagos was initially peaceful but hoodlums later hijacked the protest, destroying public and private properties, including police stations. No fewer than 20 police stations were destroyed after the protest was hijacked. Giving an update, Odumosu, in an interview with NAN on Saturday, said the federal and state governments have approved the renovation of the burnt police stations. The commissioner said the state government and the police are in charge of the supervision of the renovation. “An approval has been given by the federal government and the police authorities as well as the state government,” he said. “The state government and the police are in charge of supervising the construction, because it has to be in conformity with the police standard. “The technical officers and engineers are from the state government, while we also have engineers from various companies. So, it is a joint effort.”
