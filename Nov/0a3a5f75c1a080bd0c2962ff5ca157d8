The North East Development Commission (NEDC) has asked the national assembly to allocate five percent of value-added tax (VAT) and ecological fund to develop the region. The north-east region has been significantly affected by the activities of insurgents, leaving thousands killed and millions displaced. Speaking on Wednesday at a meeting with national assembly members and stakeholders in Abuja, Mohammed Alkali, NEDC chief executive officer (CEO), said the funds are needed to achieve the commission’s 10-year plan. Alkali said the commission’s operations would be affected “if anything happens to the VAT”. “We need an increment in the VAT and ecological fund from three percent to five percent,” he said. “If anything happens to the VAT and the ecological funds, it will affect our operations. So, we want the ratio to be increased from three percent to five percent to help us run the activities of the commission effectively.” On his part, Kasim Gidado, a consultant for the NEDC, said the 10-year plan will cover six states of the region which has 112 local government areas, adding that 80 percent of the development projects would be achieved through Public Private Partnership (PPP). “The master plan is from 2020 to 2030. We identified 11 pillars in the master plan with five main areas,” Gidado said. Also speaking, Danjuma Goje, leader of the north-east caucus in the national assembly, said the aim of establishing the commission is for the development of the region. “This meeting is an opportunity to have a first hand briefing on the commission’s activities because we want development of the north-east,” Goje added.
