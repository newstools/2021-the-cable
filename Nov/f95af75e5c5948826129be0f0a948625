Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, says he is confident that Chukwuma Soludo, former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), will thrive as governor of Anambra state. Gbajabiamila said this on Wednesday in his congratulatory message to the governor-elect. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Soludo, candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), as the winner of the election. The APGA candidate secured 112,229 votes to defeat his two major rivals — Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 53,807 votes, and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who secured 43,285 votes. According to a statement issued by Lanre Lasisi, the speaker’s spokesman, Gbajabiamila said Soludo has demonstrated integrity in his professional life and will do more as governor of the south-east state. “You are taking office at a time of profound challenges and tremendous opportunity in our country. All of us who hold public office have an obligation at this moment in history to take active measures, guided by considerations of the best interests of our people, to overcome these challenges and provide conditions for our citizens to thrive,” the statement reads. “You have in your professional life shown a tremendous capacity for effectiveness; you have demonstrated personal integrity and have already accomplished much more than most can ever hope for. “I am confident that you will thrive in this new role, and your service will glorify God and elevate the people of Anambra State and all of Nigeria. I wish you success, and I assure you of my support.”
