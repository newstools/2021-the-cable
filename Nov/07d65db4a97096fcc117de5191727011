The price of petrol at N165.89 per litre in Nigeria is the third cheapest in Africa and the lowest in West Africa. Using the FX rate of N411.64 per dollar (I&E), findings by TheCable Index showed that the price also places Nigeria as the seventh cheapest nation in terms of fuel pump price in the world. The findings, using the latest statistical data from Globalpetrolprices.com, a platform that tracks retail fuel prices in over 150 countries, showed that Angola topped the list of cheapest petrol prices on the continent — at N112.78 per litre. Nigeria and Angola have been the biggest oil producer in Africa, but subsidy policies in the two countries eroded gains. A 2020 report put subsidy spending at about $3.5 billion in Angola while Nigeria spent $7 billion between 2019 and 2020. The federal government has said it will end the fuel subsidy regime in 2022, replacing it with N5,000 monthly transportation grants to the poorest Nigerians, the labour union kicked against it. In Algeria, the pump price was recorded as the second lowest at N136.25 for a litre while Ethiopia and Egypt sell at N225.16 and N242.04 per litre, earning the fourth and fifth positions, respectively. <img class="alignnone wp-image-632639 size-full" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price.jpeg" alt="" width="884" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price.jpeg 884w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price-259x300.jpeg 259w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price-768x890.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price-21x24.jpeg 21w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price-31x36.jpeg 31w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fuel-price-41x48.jpeg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" /> Across Africa, Morocco has the highest rate of petrol pump price at N534.72 per litre.

All countries have access to the same petroleum prices at the international markets but impose different taxes or bear cost through subsidy payments.
