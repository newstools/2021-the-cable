FC Barcelona Femeni have confirmed the injury lay-off of Asisat Oshoala, Super Falcons captain, for two months. The Spanish club announced Oshoala’s injury in a statement on its official website on Friday. Oshoala picked up the knee injury on Wednesday during Barcelona’s comfortable 4-0 victory against TSG Hoffenheim of Germany in the UEFA Women’s Champions League group stage fixture. She was substituted in the 63rd minute for Ana-Maria Crnogorčević. The statement said the posterior cruciate ligament on the 27-year-old’s right knee was hurt by the knock. “According to the Club’s Medical Services, Asisat Oshoala has a ruptured posterior cruciate ligament in her right knee. The Nigerian striker, who was injured in the second half of Wednesday’s match against Hoffenheim, will be out for about two months,” the statement read. The injury lay-off will be Oshoala’s third in 2021, having battled recurring ankle sprains in the first half of the year. Oshoala is in her fourth season with Barcelona and is the top scorer in the Spanish Women’s League. The four-time African Women’s Footballer of the Year has scored 12 goals in a total of 12 games across all competitions this season.
