Ajao Adejumo, a member of the house of representatives, has defected from the African Democratic Party (ADP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Femi Gbajabiamila, the speaker of the house, announced Adejumo’s defection on the floor of the green chamber on Tuesday upon resumption of plenary session. The lower chamber had suspended sitting three weeks ago to allow its various committees to carry out legislative work on the 2022 budget. Adejumo who represents Ogbomoso north/Ogbomosho south/Oriire federal constituency of Oyo state, said he joined the APC to move the country forward. “Your (the Speaker’s) charismatic and all-inclusive, transparent and objective leadership of this house won my admiration for you and the progressives party in moving the nation forward,” the letter reads. There have been frequent defections in the lower legislative chamber in recent weeks. The ruling party has now gained at least 20 lawmakers within the past 11 months — with the majority of defectors from the PDP.
