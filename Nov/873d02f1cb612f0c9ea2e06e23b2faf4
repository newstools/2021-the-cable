LEAP Africa in collaboration with BudgIT Foundation and MacArthur Foundation has announced applications for a youth leadership programme (YLP). The deadline for application is November 24, 2021. According to LEAP Africa, the youth leadership programme will focus on providing training for youths on making significant impact in their societies. The programme “seeks to empower, equip and support young change leaders, who are at the forefront of providing effective and innovative social change solutions, with the skills, knowledge and support system required for them to build sustainable organisations”. The YLP is expected to run for four months — from November 2021 to February 2022 — and is a “blended Leadership programme for young Nigerian undergraduates aged 18 – 30years which aims to equip and empower them with the skills, knowledge and resources required to become transformative leaders and active citizens who will drive sustainable development in their communities”. Application is open to male or female undergraduates schooling in Nigeria, who will be committed to participating in the training programme online and will also be “available for mentoring”. Applicants must also be familiar with the sustainable development goals (SGDs), be interested in volunteering activities, and “eager to understand about civic education, politics and governance” in Nigeria. Persons interested in the programme can apply here.
