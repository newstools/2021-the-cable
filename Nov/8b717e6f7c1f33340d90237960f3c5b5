Buba Marwa, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has asked the national assembly to remove a clause in the agency’s act which allows option of fine for drug offenders. According to Marwa, this will strengthen the “deterrence effect of court prosecution and conviction”. Marwa spoke on Wednesday when he appeared before the senate committee on drugs and narcotics. According to a statement issued by Femi Babafemi, NDLEA’s spokesman, Marwa said he had visited the John Tsoho, chief judge of the federal high court, on the issue of “ridiculous options” of fines given to some drug traffickers. He noted that the removal of the clause will solve the issue of judges using discretionary powers to give option of fine. Speaking on the budget, Marwa said though the N38.1 billion proposed for 2022 is inadequate for the agency, it is an improvement on the previous budgets. “As such, we want to thank President Muhammadu Buhari, the finance minister, attorney-general and minister of justice and more importantly, the leadership of the national assembly and this esteemed committee on drugs and narcotics for giving us all the support we need to make the progress being talked about today,” he stated. Hezekiah Dimka, chairman of the committee, commended Marwa and the agency for the achievements recorded in the fight against illicit drugs. “There is no doubt that his approach and manner of operations to the fight against drug trafficking and abuse on our shores is extraordinary,” he added.
