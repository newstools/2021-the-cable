Gunmen have kidnapped Henry Madumere, the father of Eze Madumere, former deputy governor of Imo state. The 89-year-old was abducted on Friday at Iho community in Ikeduru LGA of the state. The former deputy governor confirmed the incident. Madumere, who is the traditional ruler of Ezi-Mbieri community in Mbaitoli LGA, was reportedly kidnapped after the gunmen shot sporadically to scare the people in the area. The ex-deputy governor also said his father’s abductors have contacted the family. He, however, did not give further details on request for ransom. Michael Abattam, spokesperson of the Imo police command, said the force has commenced an investigation into the incident. Over the past months, the south-east has witnessed an increase in criminal activities ranging from killings of security agents and residents, as well as the destruction of government and private properties. A series of kidnappings have also been recorded in the region.
