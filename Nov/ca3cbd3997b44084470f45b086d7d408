Shola Jejeloye, chairman of the Lagos environmental sanitation and special offences unit (taskforce), says the state’s decision to crush 482 motorcycles is backed by law. On Saturday, 482 motorcycles seized by the state for “violating traffic laws” were crushed. The development elicited varied reactions, with some persons saying the state should have imposed fines instead of destroying the motorcycles. Speaking to NAN on Tuesday, Jejeloye said the action was in enforcement of Lagos traffic regulations. “I derive no joy in destroying the means of livelihood of people. The traffic law of Lagos state prohibits motorcycles from plying some roads. This includes driving against traffic and on BRT lanes, but the motorcyclists always disobey the traffic laws,” he said. “We are to enforce the law. You cannot disobey the law and expect enforcement agents not to do their job. If you break the law, you face the consequences. “Lagos state is not a banana republic. All rules and regulations of the state must be enforced. “In some parts of the state, there are residents commending and celebrating our efforts against the lawlessness of commercial motorcyclists but some areas are joining the riders to fight us for implementing government directives.” The chairman, who expressed concern over the number of young men in the state who are “unwilling to be meaningfully engaged”, said such attitude constitutes security threat to Lagos. “The taskforce has placed undercover operatives around many areas to monitor such people,’’ he said. He, however, said the state will not condone unprofessionalism in the discharge of the duties of taskforce officials. According to him, seven taskforce officials have been sent to the state police command provost for trial over “unprofessional conduct”.
