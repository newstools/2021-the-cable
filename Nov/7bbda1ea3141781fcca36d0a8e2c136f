Nnaemeka Achebe, Obi of Onitsha, has called on the federal government and the Anambra state government to show more interest in the take-off of the operations of the Zik Mausoleum and conference centre. According to a statement by Chinyelugo Anionwu, his chief of staff, the Obi was speaking on Tuesday at this year’s edition of the Zik lecture anniversary celebrations in Awka, Anambra state. The lecture series was instituted by Ben Obi as benefactor and has been organised since 2011 by Nnamdi Azikiwe University, faculty of social sciences in memory of the late Nnamdi Azikiwe, first president of of Nigeria. The Obi said Ndigbo remains grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the completion of the physical structure of the Zik Mausoleum and its inauguration. He, however, said following the inauguration of the Zik mausoleum, not much has happened with regard to the take-off of its operations. “Although the federal ministry of works and housing has established the presidential committee for the management and maintenance of the Zik Mausoleum, it is difficult to point to any substantial outcome,” he said. “With the completion of the physical structure, arrangements for the take-off of the operations of the mausoleum including its management should come under the purview of the National Commission of Museum and Monuments which has statutory responsibility for museums and monuments. We believe this would facilitate commencement of the operations of the mausoleum.’’ Achebe also expressed gratitude to the organisers of the lecture series and asked them to keep the excellent work going.
