The Lagos government has called for restraint over “arguments” on the report of the state judicial panel on police brutality. On Monday, the panel submitted two documents — a consolidated report on cases of police brutality and another on the Lekki incident investigation — to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state. Speaking after the report was submitted, Sanwo-Olu constituted a four-member committee to come up with a white paper on the recommendations of the panel within two weeks. Hours after submission of the report, the 309-page document appeared in the media space. In the report, the panel said the “killing of unarmed protesters by soldiers on October 20, 2020 could be described in the context of a ‘massacre’”. The report has elicited varied reactions, with some persons commending the panel and some citing errors in the document currently in circulation. Reacting to the development in a statement issued on Wednesday by Gbenga Omotoso, commissioner for information, the Lagos government said there is a need to exercise restraint from nullifying the good intentions behind setting up the panel. “The Lagos state government has noted the various reactions that have followed the submission of the report of the judicial panel of inquiry on restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and other matters,” the statement reads. “There have been arguments in the public space over the report. There is a need for us to restrain ourselves from nullifying the good intentions of the government in setting up this panel, which was well encouraged to do its job – a fact that was acknowledged by the Panel. “In accordance with the Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015, a committee has been set up to bring up a white paper on the report to determine the next line of action. “At the appropriate time, the government will make known its views on all the issues raised by the panel through the release of a white paper.”
