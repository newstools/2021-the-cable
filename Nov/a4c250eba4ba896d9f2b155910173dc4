Ahmed Matane, secretary to Niger state government, says Boko Haram and a faction of the Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) are setting up camps in the state. Speaking at a press conference in Minna, Niger capital city, on Tuesday, Matane said these groups have been telling communities that they are “God-send” and want to establish a caliphate. The SSG said the insurgents have been asking the people to forsake western education and embark on “civil disobedience”. “These people often go to communities to communicate with them and assure them that they will not harm them, and join them during Friday congregational prayer to preach to them on the need to forsake western education and embark on civil disobedience,” he said. “Now they have made some audio recordings saying that they are there, that they are not kidnappers, that they are a religious organisation that is poised to establish a caliphate that will deal with issues of criminality and other related issues. “They are the same people that kidnapped the Dodo of Wawa, they assured us that they are not bandits, that they are there because they are God sent. “ISWAP is trying to establish a camp at National Park at Babana in Borgu LGA of the state.” Matane lamented that Niger has spent so much money to tackle insecurity but the security challenges are rising, and adding that the “collaboration” between the insurgents and bandits is making the situation worse.
