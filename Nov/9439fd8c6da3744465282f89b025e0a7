Arik Air says it has suspended one of its staff members caught by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for allegedly soliciting a bribe from a traveller in Lagos. The management said this in a statement on Wednesday. The airline management said it would also conduct an internal investigation and cooperate with FAAN on the matter. “The management of Arik Air (in Receivership) has suspended with immediate effect one of its staff caught by the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for soliciting bribe at the domestic wing of the Murtala Mohammed International, Ikeja, Lagos, pending further investigations,” the statement reads. “While the management conducts its own internal investigation, we wish to reassure FAAN of our cooperation on this matter if further investigation is required. We fully support what FAAN is doing to rid our airports of this menace of corruption.” The airport authority had expressed worry over incessant extortion of passengers by airport officials at the nation’s airports.
