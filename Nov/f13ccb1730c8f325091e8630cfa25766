Akinyemi Farounbi, Nigeria’s former ambassador to the Philippines, says operatives of the Western Nigeria Security Network, codenamed Amotekun, would be the best for local security if well-funded. In January, south-west governors launched Amotekun as a regional outfit to tackle challenges of insecurity, including kidnapping and banditry. Commenting on the operations of the security outfit, Farounbi, in an interview in Ibadan, said Amotekun is different from other security agencies since its personnel are drawn from the grassroots, and they understand the culture and language of the people. The former ambassador said Amotekun will be the best in terms of securing the people at the local level, if the areas of prosecution of criminals and approval of weapons are also addressed. He said Amotekun should be well-funded to enable the outfit achieve its security mandate, as well as discourage operatives from extorting citizens. “They can be informal without being regimented like other agencies. They are feared more by bandits and criminals. Amotekun is one of the best decisions made by the government,” he said. “For now, I know it is not adequately funded. I know the Amotekun security outfit would love to have at least 15 to 25 persons per local government area in Oyo state, but they need funds. “When an agency is well funded and the welfare of the personnel is well taken care of to compensate for the dangers they face from bandits, kidnappers among others, the tendency to extort would not be there.”
