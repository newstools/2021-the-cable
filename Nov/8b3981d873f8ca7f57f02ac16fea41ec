Armed robbers killed a policeman and a special marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Aramoko-Ekiti when they raided a bank on Monday. According to NAN, a source said the robbers invaded the bank through Igede-Ado-Ekiti road after work hours. The source said the robbers blew up the main door to the banking hall with explosives to gain access. He said the gun-wielding robbers had shot the police officer on guard before blowing up the main door. “The special marshal who was in his private vehicle was also not lucky as he ran into the barricade mounted by the armed robbers to prevent access to the area. He was shot and killed on his approach,” he said. “The effect of the dynamite threw the town into pandemonium as houses and shops in the area were affected.” The robbers were said to have escaped through the newly-constructed Erijiyan-Ikogosi road with their loot after the operation which lasted for about 30 minutes. Sunday Abutu, Ekiti state police spokesman, confirmed that two persons were killed in the attack. “It was an attempted robbery, but they were repelled. Our men and officers of Rapid Response Squad gave them a hot chase and recovered two vehicles they used for the operation,” he said. “The policeman they killed was outside the bank while the FRSC special marshal was also shot at a distance to the bank. “The police have swung into action and we will make sure that we get to the root of this matter.”
