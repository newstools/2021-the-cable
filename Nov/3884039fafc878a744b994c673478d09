Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, says Nigeria’s digital economy will soon be ranked among the best in the world. Pantami said this on Tuesday at the second national conference of the School of Science and Technology (SOST) at the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. He said the theme of the conference, ‘The Role of Science, Technology and Innovations in a Digital Economy: Towards Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’, was timely in relation to the objective of digital economy. “It is quite important because our nation Nigeria is at a point where it is evolving into one of the nations that will in the next couple of years be regarded as one of the leading digital economies in the world,” NAN quoted Pantami as saying. “This is the desire of the ministry and President Muhammadu Buhari that all agencies under the ministry of communications and digital economy, private sector and stakeholder companies are working towards Nigeria’s digital economy. “Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) are seen as the main enablers of realising some, if not all, of SDGs such as ending hunger through agrictech, no poverty through ICT, good health, among others.” Represented by Muhammad Abubakar, managing director of Galaxy Backbone Plc, the minister defined digital economy as economic activity resulting from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, devices, data and processes. He said the country’s digital economy is taking shape and undermining conventional notions about how businesses are structured, how firms interact and how consumers obtain services, information and goods.
