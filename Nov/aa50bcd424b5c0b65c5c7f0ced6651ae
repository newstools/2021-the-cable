Other European countries on the CDC’s list of “level four” countries are Austria, Britain, Belgium, Greece, Norway, Switzerland, Romania, Ireland and the Czech Republic. “Avoid travel to these destinations. If you must travel to these destinations, make sure you are fully vaccinated before travel,” the advisory reads.
