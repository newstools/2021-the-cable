The national assembly has transmitted the electoral act amendment bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent. Babajide Omoworare, senior special assistant to the president on national assembly (senate), disclosed this in a statement on Friday. “Please be informed that in pursuance of Section 58 (3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Acts Authentication Act Cap. A2 LFN 2004, the National Assembly has transmitted the Electoral Bill 2021 to Mr. President today Friday November 19, 2021,” Omoworare said. Last week, both chambers of the national assembly approved the conference committee report on the bill. The senate and house of representatives passed different versions of the bill, and this led to the setting up of a conference committee. In July, the senate empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to determine the electronic transmission of election results. The provision resulted in criticism of the lawmakers, with many Nigerians calling on the senate to follow the example of the house of representatives which adopted the use of technology “where practicable”. In the conference committee report, both chambers of the national assembly empowered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to determine the best mode to transmit election results. The electoral commission will now have the power to decide how to transmit election results — either electronically or manually. Both chambers also approved that all political parties must use the direct primary mode in picking candidates.
