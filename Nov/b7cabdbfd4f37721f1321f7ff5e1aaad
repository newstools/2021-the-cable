Orji Kalu, chief whip of the senate, says he will do a better job at motivating the Super Eagles than Gernot Rohr, the team’s head coach. The senator spoke in a recent chat with NAN wherein he condemned the coaching style of the Franco-German coach. Rohr, who was hired in 2016, has attracted a wave of backlash in recent months over a series of unimpressive performances. The criticism reached a crescendo after the Eagles struggled to beat Cape Verde at the Teslim Balogun Stadium on Tuesday. Although the 1-1 draw was sufficient to see Nigeria through to the final round of the qualifiers, the NFF executives have begun to review the team’s performance in that game, with the fate of 68-year-old gaffer as Eagles coach to be determined next week. Speaking on the Eagles, Kalu said he doesn’t see “anything good” in Rohr. He added that he can do a better job at motivating the team than the Franco-German manager. He also urged the NFF to seek a Nigerian as a replacement for Rohr after his eventual sacking. “Gernot Rohr is not a motivator to the players because he has nothing to offer; I can even motivate the players more than him because I’m a super motivator of my players,” he said. “He is not a coach; I don’t see anything good in him; he has no stamina, no strategy, he doesn’t play any system, and his team doesn’t excite me. “Where the coach comes from doesn’t matter. We have a lot of Nigeria coaches whom if you pay them what is due to them, they will do the job well. “We have a lot of coaches both locally and international, and I’m sure NFF President Amaju Pinnick knows these people. “If he is in doubt, he should consult me and I will tell him some names of coaches he can approach, whether local or international. “If you ask me, I will prefer a Nigerian to coach the Super Eagles, but he should be paid well and given a schedule of international standard to operate.
