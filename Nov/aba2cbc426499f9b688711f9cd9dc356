Echeng Eworo, Anambra commissioner of police, has asked hotels in the state to, henceforth, submit their guest lists to the nearest divisional police headquarters every day. The development was announced as part of new security measures for the state. Anambra has witnessed a wave of attacks by gunmen in recent months, leading to kidnappings and killings — including the murder of Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Dora Akunyili, ex-minister of information and communication. A statement issued on Sunday by Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesman, advised private and public hospitals in the state “to admit persons in need of medical treatment but promptly report anyone with bullet wounds or any related injuries to the nearest police station”. According to NAN, the police urged residents to cooperate with security operatives as part of efforts to address insecurity in the state. “Report promptly any suspicious movement within your environment to the nearest police station or call emergency number 112 or command control room number: 07039194332,” the statement reads. “Report promptly any missing vehicles to the nearest police station or call the emergency/control room numbers, 112 and 07039194332 respectively.” The police also urged parents and guardians to pay close attention to the activities of their children and wards as anyone caught to have violated the security directives would face prosecution. Members of the public were also advised to desist from jungle justice and report suspects to the nearest police station. Eworo also asked Anambra residents to to obey the state’s directive on the ban on vehicles with tinted glasses and covered number plates. He assured the public of the commitment of security operatives to protecting lives and property in the state.
