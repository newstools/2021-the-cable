The police in Ogun have arrested three suspected kidnappers who were attempting to collect ransom in the state. In a statement on Thursday, Abimbola Oyeyemi, spokesman of the Ogun police command, said the suspects are aged between 22 and 26. Oyeyemi said the arrest was made in collaboration with Nigerian Army and So Safe Corps who had laid an ambush for the suspects. “The operatives swiftly moved to the area and laid ambush,” NAN quoted him as saying. “The hoodlums appeared to collect the ransom and the operatives engaged them in a gun duel. “Having realised that they were about to be overpowered, they took to their heels but were chased and three among them were apprehended. “Other members of the gang escaped with gunshot injuries which made them eventually abandon their victims, who were rescued unhurt and reunited with their families.” The spokesman said Lanre Bankole, commissioner of police, expressed satisfaction with the team that made the arrest. He said the police commissioner ordered immediate transfer of the suspects to the anti-kidnapping unit of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for thorough investigation. According to him, Bankole directed that the escaped members of the gang should be found and brought to justice.
