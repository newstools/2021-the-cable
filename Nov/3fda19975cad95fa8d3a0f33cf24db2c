Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has finally been relieved of his duties as Manchester United’s manager. The English club broke the news in a statement via all its social media pages on Sunday morning. The 48-year-old Norwegian coach was sacked as Manchester United head coach after a poor run of performances and results. Solskjaer’s dismissal came following an emergency board meeting held overnight after the Red Devils lost 4-1 to Watford on Saturday afternoon. “Manchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as manager,” the statement read. “Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision. While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success. “Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as Manager and our very best wishes for the future. His place in the club’s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a Manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.” The club also added that Michael Carrick, another ex-Manchester United player, will take charge until an interim manager is appointed. “Michael Carrick will now take charge of the team for forthcoming games, while the club looks to appoint an interim manager to the end of the season,” the statement read. Manchester United have won just three matches from ten in all competition, with four losses in their past six league matches. Solskjaer, former Swansea coach, is leaving Man United after two years and eight months in charge of the 20-time English Premier League (EPL) winners. He also failed to win any silverware with the club where he made his mark as a player, losing last season’s Europa League final to Villarreal on penalties.
