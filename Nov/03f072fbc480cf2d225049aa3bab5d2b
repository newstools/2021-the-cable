The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says its officials have apprehended the staff member of an airline for allegedly extorting a traveller in Lagos. Henrietta Yakubu, general manager, corporate affairs of FAAN, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. According to her, the airline worker was caught at the general aviation terminal of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. The name of the airline worker was, however, not given. “Following an emergency FAAN Management meeting on the incessant extortion of passengers by airport officials at the nation’s airports and steps being taken to address the situation, which had in attendance the MD/CE, Directors of the Authority, Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, Airport Managers and Airport Chiefs of Security, a staff of Arik airline had been apprehended while soliciting bribe from a travelling passenger at the General Aviation Terminal, Lagos,” the statement reads. “The On Duty Card of the erring staff has been withdrawn immediately, and she has been handed over to relevant security agency for appropriate action in order to serve as deterrent to other bad eggs in the airport. “Recent embarrassing online videos where passengers complained of acts of extortion at the nation’s airport had necessitated the need to devise multi level strategies to curb the menace. “The meeting also resolved that henceforth, any erring airport official caught soliciting for bribes at the nation’s airports will be permanently denied access to working at the airports. “Officials were also directed to always wear conspicuous name tags anytime they are on duty. “The MD/CE, Captain Yadudu, further directed the Airport Managers to ensure that all stakeholders at the airports are properly sensitized on the new development as there will be no sacred cows.”
