Steve Omojafor, chairman, board of trustees (BOT) of the Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria (AAAN), has lauded the recently announced Advertising Industry Standard of Operating Procedure (AISOP). The AISOP was launched by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), the sector regulator. In a statement on Tuesday, Omojafor also commended Olalekan Fadolapo, chief executive officer/registrar of APCON, for supporting the proposed procedure, saying it will be of immense benefits to the industry. “This is long overdue, and the members of AAAN are convinced it is in the interest of the industry and to the benefit of all advertising practitioners, whether they are on agency side or client side,” Omojafor said. He also commended the APCON CEO for the role he played in the process that birthed the AISOP, adding that it will result in increased professionalism in the industry. He said it was “most gratifying” that almost all the heads of sectoral groups in the advertising and marketing industry have signed off on the document. Omojafor urged all the groups to urgently commence the sensitisation of their members and clients on the steps needed for the full implementation of the new operating procedures towards improving the marketing communication industry. He also called for the early adoption of AISOP as a panacea for eradicating unfair advantages, unethical competition and inequitable policies in the country’s advertising and marketing communications industry, particularly the provision of standardised minimum commercial terms for all stakeholders in the development of the industry.
