At least 11 persons have been reportedly killed following an attack by gunmen on Ta’agbe community in Bassa LGA of Plateau state. Thirty houses were also said to have been set ablaze by the gunmen who attacked the community in the early hours of Friday. Uba Ogba, police spokesperson in Plateau, confirmed the attack and said officers have been deployed to restore calm in the area. Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau, condemned the attack, describing it as the handiwork of criminals who are bent on “instilling fear, pain and sorrow” among residents. In a statement issued by Makut Macham, his spokesperson, Lalong said the state government will do everything within its powers to bring the attackers to justice. “This is another sad incident which is clearly the handiwork of criminals who are bent on instilling fear, pain and sorrow among the people,” the statement reads. “This is [aimed] at destabilising the state and making fortune from their criminality as well as rupturing the substantial peace attained. The persistent attacks in this area remain condemnable and unacceptable to government. “As such, no resources and efforts will be spared in painstakingly following up on the trail of those who derive joy in attacking and killing innocent citizens and destroying their homes and means of livelihoods.” Lalong also directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the Plateau peace building agency (PPBA) to provide relief items to the victims of the attack.
