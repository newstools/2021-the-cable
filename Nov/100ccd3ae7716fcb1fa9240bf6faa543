The Benue police command says gunmen attacked and killed four mourners at Imande Abur village, Mbategh ward of Logo LGA of the state. The police said another person was injured during the attack that occurred on Saturday. Catherine Anene, police public relations officer in the state, confirmed this in a statement on Sunday. According to Anene, the gunmen, three in number, attacked the mourners at a wake “and shot sporadically at mourners who assembled at a funeral ceremony.” “Police teams within the area swiftly moved to the area, but the suspects took to their heels on sighting the police,” the statement reads. “Five persons sustained gunshot injuries and were rushed to hospital for treatment but unfortunately four of them lost their lives while receiving treatment.” The police commiserated with families of the victims and assured that justice would “definitely be served as detectives are already on the trail of the suspects”.
