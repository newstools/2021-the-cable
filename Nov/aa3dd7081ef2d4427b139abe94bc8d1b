The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested one Olayinka Adisa, a businesswoman, for ingesting 80 pellets of cocaine. Adisa, identified as a 46-year-old who hails from Kwara state, was arrested on November 24, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on her way to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah (lesser hajj). In a statement on Monday, Femi Babafemi, NDLEA spokesman, said the suspect lives in Ibafo, Ogun state, adding that Adisa said she needed to raise N7 million naira for In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment. “She was arrested on Wednesday, Nov. 24, at the boarding screening area of the airport during an outward clearance of Qatar Airways flight 1418,” the statement reads. “She was subsequently taken into custody where she excreted 80 pellets of the illicit drug between Wednesday and Saturday. “She claimed during interrogation that she saved N2.5million over a period of one year to buy the drugs in bits from six different people at Akala, Mushin area of Lagos.’’ According to Babafemi, the suspect claimed to be in the clothing business but had to borrow N1 million from three people to purchase the drugs. “She spent another N1 million to renew her passport, obtain a visa and buy return flight tickets,” he said. “She said she was encouraged to traffic the drugs by a woman she met during her last Umrah trip to Saudi Arabia in 2019. “She said she needed to raise N7 million for In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment due to pressure from people because she’s been married for 28 years without a child due to fertility challenges.” The agency said it also arrested one Inusa Abdulrazaki with 101 wraps of heroin weighing 1.3 kilograms on November 19. He was said to have been arrested at the departure hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, on his way to Italy via Istanbul. According to NDLEA, “the drugs were concealed inside cassava flour popularly called garri”.
