West Ham United delivered a stunning 3-2 win over Liverpool in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at the London stadium on Sunday. Alisson Becker’s own goal started a jubilant day for West Ham who scored further goals through Pablo Fornals and Kurt Zouma in the second period. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s equalizer initially pegged back the Londoners while Divock Origi’s late goal could not spark a revival. The Reds drop to fourth on the EPL table with 22 points from 11 matches, overtaken by David Moyes’ West Ham who are a point ahead in third place. Earlier in the day, Arsenal’s potential renaissance continued with a narrow 1-0 win over Watford. Tottenham were however held to a goalless draw against Everton in Antonio Conte’s first league game as Spurs manager, while the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled out a goal for Leicester as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Leeds.
