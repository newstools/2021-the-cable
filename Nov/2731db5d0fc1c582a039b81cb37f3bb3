The federal government has commended the United States government for removing Nigeria from the list of countries blacklisted for “engaging in violation of religious freedom”. In December 2020, the US-listed Nigeria among countries blacklisted for “violating religious freedom”. At the time, Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, described the US allegation as a case of “honest disagreement between the two nations on the causes of violence in Nigeria”. In a statement on Wednesday, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, announced 10 countries “of particular concern”, with Nigeria now missing from the list. In a reaction to the development, Mohammed said Nigeria does not engage in religious freedom violation or have a policy of religious persecution. The minister said Nigeria “jealously” protects religious freedom as enshrined in the country’s constitution, adding that the country “takes seriously any infringement in that regard”. “We will continue to ensure that every Nigerian has the freedom to practise his or her own chosen religion or belief without hindrance,” the minister said in a statement by Segun Adeyemi, his spokesperson, on Thursday. The minister also commended religious leaders in the country “who have been working to ensure religious harmony”.
