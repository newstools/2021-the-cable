Lionel Messi has beaten Robert Lewandowski to claim a record seventh men’s Ballon d’Or award. The award ceremony, which returned after a year’s hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was held at the Théâtre du Chatelet in Paris, France on Monday evening. The Paris Saint-Germain forward ended his long wait for a major international trophy when he helped Argentina win the Copa America in the summer. He also guided Barcelona to Copa del Rey glory before moving to the French capital in August. Lewandowski, however, won the maiden ‘Striker of the Year’ award – one of the two new awards introduced by France Football in 2021. In the women’s category, Alexia Putellas, Barcelona’s midfielder, clinched the Ballon d’Or to become the third woman to achieve the feat. The 27-year-old captained her club to the Champions League title last season, ending Lyon’s five-year reign. She was recently named ‘UEFA Player of the Year’ and also lifted the Spanish league and cup last season, completing the treble. Pedri claimed the Kopa Trophy, the award for best performing player under the age of 21. The 19-year-old Spaniard, who recently won the ‘Golden Boy’ prize, also came 24th in this year’s Ballon d’Or. Gianluigi Donnarumma beat Edouard Mendy, Jan Oblak, Ederson, and Manuel Neuer respectively to clinch the Yashin Trophy, which is the award for best goalkeeper. The Italian claimed the prize after finishing 10th in the Ballon d’Or. Aside from the regular categories of the men and women’s Ballon d’Or, Kopa Trophy, and Yashin Trophy, France Football also introduced the ‘Best Club’ and ‘Best Striker of the Year’ in the 2021 class. The 2021 Balloon d’Or is the 65th annual award ceremony organised to recognise the best footballers in the world. Full list of winners:
