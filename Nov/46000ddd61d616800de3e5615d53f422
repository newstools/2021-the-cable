D’Tigers bounced back from their 2021 FIBA World Cup qualifier opener defeat to Cape Verde to record a slim victory over Mali. The Nigerian men’s basketball team pipped their Malian counterparts 72-70 to stand a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. It was a 3-1 victory for the Nigerian side in the four-set game on Saturday. D’Tigers had a narrow edge over the Malians in the first quarter to win 16-15 points. The Malians had a ten points lead over Julius Nwosu’s boys in the second quarter to run away with a 24-14 win. The third and fourth quarters saw the Nigerian side dig deep to win the game by 23-15 and 19-16 points respectively. D’Tigers will now take on Uganda in their last Group A match on Sunday night at the same venue. Five African teams will earn a spot at the FIBA Basketball World Cup that is scheduled to take place from August 25 to September 10, 2023, in Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
