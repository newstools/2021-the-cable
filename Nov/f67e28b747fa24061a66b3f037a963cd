Manchester United have appointed Ralf Rangnick as the club’s interim manager until the end of the season. Rangnick’s appointment was announced in a statement released on the club’s website on Monday. The 63-year-old German will hold the position till June 2022, after which he is expected to move on to “a consultancy role for a further two years.” “Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season, subject to work visa requirements,” the statement read. “Following this period, Ralf and the club have agreed that he will continue in a consultancy role for a further two years.” Speaking on his new role, Rangnick expressed excitement at managing a squad that he said: “is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience”. He also said that he looks forward to “supporting the club’s longer-term goals on a consultancy basis.” “I am excited to be joining Manchester United and focused on making this a successful season for the club,” the manager added. “The squad is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience. All my efforts for the next six months will be on helping these players fulfil their potential, both individually and, most importantly, as a team. “Beyond that, I look forward to supporting the club’s longer-term goals on a consultancy basis.” Michael Carrick, who had taken charge of the team since the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer earlier this month, will remain in charge of the first team until the German’s work permit is finalised.
