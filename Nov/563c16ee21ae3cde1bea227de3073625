Steven Gerrard, the former Rangers manager, has been appointed as the new head coach of Aston Villa on a three-and-a-half-year deal. The former Liverpool captain was unveiled on Thursday, replacing Dean Smith, who was dismissed on Sunday after a run of five successive defeats. The 41-year-old is leaving Rangers after helping the club to win the Scottish Premiership last season — their first league title in 10 years. “Aston Villa is a club with a rich history and tradition in English football and I am immensely proud to become its new head coach,” Gerrard said. “In my conversations with Nassef, Wes and the rest of the Board, it was apparent how ambitious their plans are for the club and I am looking forward to helping them achieve their aims. “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everybody associated with Glasgow Rangers for giving me the opportunity to manage such an iconic football club. “Helping them secure a record-breaking 55th league title will always hold a special place in my heart. I would like to wish the players, staff and supporters the very best for the future.” Aston Villa currently occupy the 16th spot in the English Premier League (EPL) table — two points above the relegation zone — after 11 games of their campaign.
