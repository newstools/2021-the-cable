Osita Okechukwu, director-general of Voice of Nigeria (VON), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to release Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Speaking with journalists on Sunday in Abuja, Okechukwu also asked IPOB to support a candidate of Igbo extraction in the 2023 presidential election. “I join Ohaneze Ndigbo, eminent constitutional lawyer and chairman, Igbo leaders of thought, professor Ben Nwabueze, and people of goodwill nationwide in commending President Muhammadu Buhari for accepting to consider the release of the held leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu,” NAN quoted Okechukwu as saying. “I also appeal to IPOB to support Nigeria President of Igbo extraction 2023 project. Methinks IPOB support will kill two birds with one stone. “All am saying is that Mr President and a host of other Nigerians are silently in support of Nigeria president of Igbo extraction 2023 project, but are wary and reticent of IPOB stance. “Therefore, in my little opinion, IPOB support of our project will kill two birds with one stone. My understanding of IPOB agitation is to end Igbo marginalisation, if that’s the case then our 2023 Nigeria President of Igbo extraction will be the end of the civil war. Nigerians are waiting for IPOB to change gear.” TheCable had reported that Buhari said he would consider releasing Kanu. The president said this on Friday when he hosted Igbo leaders led by Mbazulike Amaechi, former minister of aviation, who appealed for the release of Kanu.
