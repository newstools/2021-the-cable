Nigeria’s D’Tigers have opened their 2023 FIBA World Cup qualifier campaign with a defeat to Cape Verde. The 2015 African champions fell 71-79 to Cape Verde on Friday morning at the Benguela, Pavilhão Multiusos Acácias Rubras. The Nigerian men’s basketball team started the game on a high note with a 20-18 lead in the first quarter. D’Tigers, however, narrowly lost the second quarter 15-16 to Cape Verde. They rallied back into the game with a three-point advantage of 20-17 in the third quarter. The Julius Nwosu boys then failed to pull their weight in the fourth quarter and ended up losing 16-28 points. D’Tigers will take on Mali in the second qualification game on Saturday. The game is scheduled to take place at 2 pm local time.
