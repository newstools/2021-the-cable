A storey building has collapsed at Flour Mills Estate in the Badagry area of Lagos state. The Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service says the building, which was under construction, caved in on Wednesday. Several persons are trapped in the building while five victims are said to have been rescued. Margaret Adeseye, director, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, said four victims have been recovered from the rubble. “There has been a reported case of a storey building collapse at Sunny Filled, Flour Mills, Estate, Magbon, Badagry, Lagos,” the statement reads. “The Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Badagry Station had rescued 5 (five) victims from the under-construction building while concerted efforts are ongoing to rescue remaining trapped victims. “The victims which are mainly construction workers are however rescued with varying degrees of injury but in stable condition and been taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. “However, 4 (four) adults male have been recovered (unconscious) thus far as the Nigerian Police, Morogbo Division and the Community dwellers are complementing the efforts of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service.” The incident comes two weeks after a 21-storey building located in the Ikoyi area of Lagos collapsed.
