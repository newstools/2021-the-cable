The Niger government has banned the sale of motorcycles across the state. In a statement on Saturday, Ahmed Matane, secretary to the state government (SSG), said Abubakar Bello, the governor, gave the directive following the security challenges in parts of the state. The development comes months after the state government placed a ban on the activities of commercial motorcyclists. Matane said the ban covers all motorcycles with engine capacity from 185 cubic centimetres and above. “Following the incessant security challenges in some parts of Niger State and coupled with the demands of motorcycles as ransom by bandits and kidnappers, the State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has directed the immediate ban on the sales of motorcycles across the State,” the statement reads. “Government has condemned in strong terms the degree of carnage and pandemonium bandits and kidnappers are causing to some parts of the State and reiterated its continued determination to rid the State of any security threat. “Government is aware of the inconveniences the measure would cause the people, but the decision was taken in the overall interest of the State and appealed to the dealers of motorcycles across the State to cooperate with the directive.” Mantane added that the government has ordered security agencies in the state to ensure strict compliance with the directive. He also appealed to residents to cooperate with the security agencies on the security measures being put in place to put an end to banditry. The SSG added that the activities of commercial motorcycle riders, “popularly known as okada or kabu-kabu” and operations of illegal garages remain banned in Minna metropolis and surrounding areas.
