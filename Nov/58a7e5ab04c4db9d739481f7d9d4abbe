Folasade Yemi-Esan, the head of service of the federation, says all civil servants will be required to show proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination beginning from December 1. According to Premium Times, in a circular on Friday, Yemi-Esan directed all civil servants from Grade Level 12 and below to resume work on the same date and ensure they get vaccinated before resumption. In February, TheCable reported that the federal government directed all federal civil service workers on grade level 12 and below to work from home following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The circular stated that at resumption, all civil servants are requested “to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within 72 hours”. “It will be recalled that as part of the measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19 Pandemic, Officers on GL 12 and below were directed to work from home. Following the advice of the PSC on COVID-19, this category of Officers are expected to resume duties on Wednesday, 1st December 2021,” the circular added. This follows an earlier directive by Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), that workers who fail to get vaccinated will be barred from entering their places of work. In line with this, Yemi-Esan said all public officers yet to be vaccinated are advised to visit designated health facilities for vaccination. “Furthermore, in line with the recommendation of the Committee on COVID-19, Mr. President has approved the vaccine mandate policy. All Federal Government employees would therefore be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result done within 72 hours,” she said.
