About six civilians have been wounded as troops of the Nigerian Army repel an attack by suspected members of the Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) in Damboa, Borno state. The insurgents who came in about 10 gun-trucks attacked the town in the early hours of Friday. Military sources told TheCable that the insurgents came in through Sabon Gari area of the town. The attack was, however, repelled by the troops after a battle which lasted for about two hours. Sources said the insurgents who were overpowered by the troops retreated through Sandia village. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, was not immediately available to comment on the incident. Sources, however, told TheCable that troops have already taken control of the area and are currently “on a show of force” around the town. The attack comes days after nearby Askira in Askira Uba LGA was attacked. Dzarma Zirkusu, a brigadier-general, and three soldiers who were on their way to Askira for reinforcement were killed in an ambush laid by ISWAP.
