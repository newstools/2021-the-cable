Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, says the white paper on the report of the Lagos state judicial panel on police brutality will be released later on Tuesday. Sanwo-Olu said this in a broadcast at the state house, Alausa. On November 15, the Lagos judicial panel submitted two documents — a consolidated report on police brutality and an investigation into the Lekki shooting incident — to the state government. Speaking after receiving the report, the Lagos governor constituted a four-member committee to come up with a white paper on the panel’s recommendations within the next two weeks. The four-member committee is chaired by Moyosore Onigbanjo, the state attorney-general, with Segun Dawodu, commissioner for youths and social development; Aramide Adeyoye, special adviser, works and infrastructure; and Tolani Oshodi, permanent secretary, cabinet office, as members. Hours after the submission of the panel report, it was leaked on the social media, eliciting varied reactions. Speaking on Tuesday, Sanwo-Olu said his administration is committed to bringing a closure to the “painful episode” of the Lekki incident in the history of the state. The governor said the leak of the “unauthorised version” of the report reopened a deep wound and “generated much tension”. “The heated exchanges among various shades of opinion on the report have unfortunately put us all at the risk of missing the larger picture; the fact that what we all seek in common is a land in which we are all safe and secure, law enforcement agents are trusted, and justice is guaranteed for all,” he said. “Our administration is committed to a process that would bring a closure to a painful episode in the history of the state as the white paper will be issued later in the day in keeping to my earlier promise to release it within two weeks.”
