All You Need to Know About their Visit World famous urban dance duo, Laurent, and Larry Bourgeois, professionally known as Les Twins were in Lagos, Nigeria from November 11th – 13th as part of their global “Move Out Loud” campaign in collaboration with Hennessy V.S. The Twins enjoyed a vibrant two-day stay, engaging in various activities. Both cultural beacons, Hennessy V.S and Les Twins, joined forces to create a multi-media collaboration around the tagline “Move Out Loud”, to celebrate French heritage and the pioneering spirit. This campaign creates an exceptional, inclusive platform for artistic expression through live dance, music, and fashion. Les Twins (Laurent X Larry) The Twins started the day off with a meet & greet with key media personnel; in which they got the chance to speak about the collaboration, as well as their lives, engaging with the media houses represented in an intimate setting. The Twins then hosted an exclusive Dance Masterclass, featuring key stakeholders in dance and dance enthusiasts. The masterclass was exciting and energetic. Participants had the opportunity to see Les Twins live in action, and dance alongside them, which was a dream come true for many of them. Participants in the masterclass certainly learnt a thing or two from the legendary Twins and were willing to give hands-on advice. It was indeed a Very Special Masterclass!

Guests included a mix of influencers, industry heads, and budding dancers. Finally, for the day, Les Twins was hosted at Zorya Nightclub for an experience of the much talked about & sought-after Lagos nightlife. The Twins took it to new heights with a vibrant dance performance which had the crowd ecstatic and yearning for more. The following afternoon, right before they jetted off to Paris, France, they were hosted to an exclusive high energy brunch at KOI Restaurant. The brunch gave the Twins one last chance to participate in a Lagos party. Guests were treated to specially crafted #HennessyxLesTwins cocktails, canapes, and a final chance to intimately engage with the Twins.
