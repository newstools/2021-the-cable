The senate has directed its committee on judiciary, human rights and legal matters to liaise with the relevant authorities to ensure the speedy prosecution of over 900 pending cases of gender-based violence (GBV) in the courts across the country. The resolution of the upper legislative chamber followed a motion sponsored by Betty Apiafi, senator representing Rivers west. Her motion was to commemorate the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. The 16 days of activism is an annual global campaign calling for an end to violence against women and girls. While moving her motion on the floor of the senate on Tuesday, Apiafi said women and girls are not just prone to gender-based violence but insecurity. The senator lamented that despite the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act and the Child Rights Act, violence against women and children is still high. Citing a report, Apiafi said only 33 cases of GBV have been determined, leaving over 900 cases pending. “There are about 975 gender-based violence cases pending in court and this is unacceptable,” she said. “The slow conviction of perpetrators is due to few courts handling such cases, illiteracy and lack of knowledge (of the relevant laws). “We can end violence against women and children if the VAPP and Child Rights Act are domesticated.” The motion was adopted after Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, put it to a voice vote.
