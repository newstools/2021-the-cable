A video of Patience, wife of former President Goodluck Jonathan, singing a birthday song for her husband while the couple were in an aircraft, has surfaced online. Jonathan, who ruled Nigeria between 2010 and 2015, clocked 64 on Saturday. In a video shared on Twitter, Patience is seen singing “happy birthday to lovely husband” while she raises a toast. At least, five other passengers were on board what appeared to be a private jet while two air hostesses served drinks. #Nigeria: Dame Patience Jonathan celebrates her husband, ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, as he turns 64 today.#AfricaFirst #NewsCentralTV pic.twitter.com/Qdd2ZanxxD — News Central TV (@NewsCentralTV) November 20, 2021
