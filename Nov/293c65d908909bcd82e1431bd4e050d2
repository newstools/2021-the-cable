The house of representatives has asked the federal government to equip personnel guarding correctional facilities with general purpose machine guns (GPMG). During plenary session on Thursday, the lower legislative chamber also mandated its committee on appropriation to include the rehabilitation and upgrade of the correctional centres in the 2022 budget estimates. The resolution was passed following the adoption of a motion sponsored by Muhammed Kazaure, a lawmaker from Jigawa state. In recent months, gunmen have targeted some prisons, freed inmates and killed security operatives. The latest attack happened in October when the correctional facility in Abolongo, Oyo state, was attacked by gunmen. Speaking on the floor of the house, Kazaure said it is dangerous for society if convicted criminals are let loose. “If adequate steps are not taken to re-arrest the escaped convicts and provide adequate security in correctional centres, some of the criminals who escaped may become more emboldened to the point of forming terrorist groups that would put the country in jeopardy,” he said. He said the federal government should rehabilitate and upgrade the correctional centres with the “latest and sophisticated arms such as GPMG and automatic machine guns and the latest security electric fence wires attached with shocking gadgets and highly sophisticated CCTV cameras”. The motion was adopted after it was put to a voice vote by Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the house.
