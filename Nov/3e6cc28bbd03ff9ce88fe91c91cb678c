Razak Bakare, a student of the Michael Otedola College of Primary Education (MOCPED) in Poka area of Epe, Lagos state, has been killed by gunmen. Ahmed Saheed, identified as a lecturer, was also shot by gunmen in a separate incident days after Bakare was killed. While Saheed was shot on Friday, the student was killed on Wednesday. Speaking on the killing of the student, Babatunde Ogunlaja, the Aladeshoyin of Odo-Noforija, called on the management of the institution to install CCTV cameras on the school premises. According to NAN, the traditional ruler said the community had been working with security agencies, vigilantes and other stakeholders to find the perpetrators. He also urged the Lagos state government to rebuild the collapsed fence in the institution which “serves as an escape route for criminals”. On his part, Olufolarin Ogunsanwo, the Alara of Ilara, who spoke on the killing of the teacher in Poka area of Epe, said the community would support efforts by security agencies to fish out the killers. Abiodun Tobun, lawmaker representing Epe constituency 1 at the Lagos house of assembly, said before the incident, the institution was known for peace since its establishment. “I totally condemn such act and I know the management of the institution will take adequate measures to prevent a repeat of such incident,” NAN quoted him as saying. He also urged the students to “know the type of friends you keep in school, do not join cultism; rather join reading/study groups and be religious”. The lawmaker added that he would work with traditional rulers and other relevant stakeholders in the fight against cultism and other social vices in the area.
