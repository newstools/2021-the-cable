Mimisen Iyorhe, the Nigerian referee, was included in the officiating team for the maiden CAF Women’s Champions League (WCL) final. CAF appointed Iyorhe as the second assistant referee for the encounter between Hasaacas Ladies of Ghana and Mamelodi Sundowns on Friday in Cairo. The Nigerian assisted Ethiopia’s Lidya Tafesse Abebe, the centre referee, alongside Queency Clodia Victorie from Mauritius and Egypt’s Shahenda Elmaghrabi. The CAF Champions League final ended 2-0, with Mamelodi Sundowns becoming the first-ever champions of women’s club football in Africa. Goals from Chuene Morifi and Andisiwe Mgcoyi were the difference as the South Africans overcame the challenges of their Ghanian oppositions. River Angels were Nigeria’s representative in the tournament. But the NWFL champions failed to make it beyond the group stages after winning just one in three games. Iyorhe had made history earlier this year after she was included in the first-ever all-women team of referees to officiate in men’s tournament. She was tapped as the second assistant referee for the Group D encounter between Namibia and Tanzania at the CHAN 2020. Iyorhe, a FIFA-badged assistant referee, has been saddled with a handful of games in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). She was also included alongside Madu Patience for the 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, which Ghana hosted.
