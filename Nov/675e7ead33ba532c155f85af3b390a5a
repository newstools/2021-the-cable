Liverpool scored three first half goals to record an easy 4-0 victory over Southampton in their English Premier League encounter at the Anfield Stadium on Saturday. Diogo Jota scored twice with further goals from Thiago Alcantara and Virgil van Dijk ensuring Liverpool reduced Chelsea’s lead at the top to just one point. The Reds got off to an easy start on two minutes with Andy Robertson setting up Jota, and the Portuguese international finished with aplomb. The 24-year-old repeated the trick 30 minutes later before Thiago’s deflected strike ensured Jurgen Klopp’s side went into the break with the game almost won. Van Dijk added gloss to the easy win eight minutes into the second period, heading beyond the goalkeeper from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s corner delivery. Consecutive wins since losing to West Ham United means Jurgen Klopp’s side improved to 28 points from 13 matches, while Southampton drop to 14th place with 14 points. In the day’s first match, Arsenal shrugged off last weekend’s loss to Liverpool with a 2-0 win over Newcastle United, EPL’s bottom-placed club. Two goals in the first ten minutes of the second half did the trick, with Bukayo Saka breaking Newcastle’s resolve before Gabriel Martinelli, a substitute, sealed victory to move Arsenal to sixth place on the log with 23 points from 13 matches. Steven Gerrard continued his winning start to life as Aston Villa coach as his side defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park, while Norwich City and Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a goalless draw.
