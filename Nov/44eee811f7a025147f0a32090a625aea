Buba Marwa, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), says no community in the country is exempted from drug abuse. Speaking on Wednesday during an interactive session with local government chairmen in Plateau state, Marwa said about 15 million Nigerians consume illicit drugs. According to him, the practice contributes to the security challenges facing the country. “As I speak to you, 15 million Nigerians use illicit drugs; one out of seven Nigerians takes hard substances,” NAN quoted him as saying. “There is no community in Nigeria that is exempted from drug abuse and this is why we keep having security challenges here and there. “Drugs propel a lot of negative actions, particularly among young people. It is destroying our youths and even the communities. “So, we have come to interact with local government chairmen, so that together we can find a lasting solution to this menace. “We want the chairmen to work with and support us to kick this hydra-headed monster called drug abuse out of our society.” He also urged the council chairmen to sensitise their various communities on the activities of the war against drug abuse (WADA) committee recently launched by President Muhammadu Buhari.
