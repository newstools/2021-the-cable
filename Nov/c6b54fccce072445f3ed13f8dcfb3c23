John Noble, the Enyimba goalkeeper, has been selected as Francis Uzoho’s replacement in the Super Eagles squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Liberia and Cape Verde. The Super Eagles announced the development via its verified Facebook page on Sunday night. “Goalkeeper John Noble (Enyimba FC) has been drafted as a replacement for Francis Uzoho, who has called in sick ahead of FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022 Match Day 5 & 6 qualifying games against Liberia (Nov. 13) & Cape Verde (Nov.16). Wishing Uzoho the soonest recovery,” the post read. Uzoho featured in Omonia Nicosia’s UEFA Conference League encounter against FC Basel of Switzerland on Thursday night but missed Sunday’s league clash against Ethnikos Achnas due to illness. Noble, on the other hand, was first invited to the Super Eagles in March for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho. The goaltender is, however, yet to make an appearance for the national team. Maduka Okoye and Daniel Akpeyi are the other goalkeepers in the squad for the qualifiers. Super Eagles players are expected to start arriving camp in Tangier, Morocco, on Monday. The Lone Stars play their home games at the Grand Stade de Tanger in Morocco after their stadiums failed to meet the Confederation of African Football’s requirements for the qualifiers. The match will hold on November 13, while Nigeria will face Cape Verde three days later as they push to book a place in the final round of qualifiers for the Qatar 2022 World Cup.
