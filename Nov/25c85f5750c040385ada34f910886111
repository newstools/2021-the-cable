A federal high court in Abuja has fixed January 17, 2022 for the arraignment of Ikedi Ohakim, a former governor of Imo state. The IGP had preferred a five-count charge against Ohakim and one Chinedu Okpareke, following a petition by one Chinyere Amuchienwa who accused both men of harassment and threatening to release her nude photos. Although the police had filed an application seeking to withdraw the charges against Ohakim and Okpareke, the office of the attorney-general of the federation had expressed interest in taking over prosecution of the case. The AGF’s application was granted by the court on September 27. At the resumed court session on Monday, A.K. Alilu, an assistant director, public prosecution of the federation, announced an appearance for the AGF, while Emeka Etiaba appeared for the first defendant (Okpareke), and Kenneth C.O. represented the former governor. Apologising over the absence of the first defendant, Etiaba said his client is in isolation due to the Omicron COVID variant, having returned from South Africa. Counsel to Ohakim also apologised for the absence of his client over health reasons. Responding, the prosecution counsel said the matter was “intentionally being stalled from going on because nobody informed the prosecution of all these developments”. However, Taiwo Taiwo, the presiding judge held that COVID-19 is not an issue to play with. He then adjourned the matter till January 17 for arraignment.
