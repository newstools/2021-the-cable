Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), says there was no diamond bra recovered from Diezani Alison-Madueke, former petroleum minister. Diezani, who had fled the county shortly before former President Goodluck Jonathan handed over to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, is alleged to have stolen $2.5 billion from the federal government while she was minister — an allegation she has denied. The EFCC has since commenced a process to extradite her. In October, he federal government had listed assets forfeited by Diezani to include properties located in Banana Island Foreshore Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos. Other items listed are 125 wedding gowns, 13 small gowns, 41 waist trainers, 73 hard flowers, 11 suits, 11 invisible bras, 73 veils, 30 braziers, two standing fans, 17 magic skirts, six blankets, one table blanket and 64 pairs of shoes. However, reports had circulated at the time that diamond bras were included in the items forfeited by the former minister. Speaking on Wednesday when he featured on Your View, a programme on TVC, the EFCC chairman said no such item was recovered from Diezani. Bawa also said one of the challenges affecting the agency’s operations is the attitude of Nigerians to the activities of the commission. “You have accused us several times of media trial, but I think it’s good to be fair to everybody at all times. Justice is a two-way thing. There was nothing like diamond bra. It’s a creation of social media,” he said. “I can tell you that for free because I am the lead investigator on that. I’m not aware of it. If there is something on that, I should know because I led the search and all of that. “And that is one of the things that I mentioned to you that the biggest problem that we have is our attitude. We need to change for the better.”
