Tanko Yakasai, founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum, says Bola Tinubu sought his support for the 2023 presidential election. According to the Punch, Yakasai said he would support Tinubu, chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), after the politician visited him on Wednesday. “I don’t want to join any (political) party but I can support a candidate of my choice. I have said it way back in 1951 that I will not be a party member but I will support a candidate of my choice,” Yakasai said. “He (Tinubu) just came to visit me but actually I have two of them (presidential aspirants) that I have earmarked right from the beginning and I made a vow that any one of them who came to ask for my support first is the person I would support. Tinubu is the first person. “He (Tinubu) did and he asked for my support,” Yakasai responded when asked if Tinubu told him of his presidential ambition.” Although Tinubu is yet to officially declare his interest in the presidential seat, various groups have begun rallies to canvass support for him. In October, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos state governor, joined other Lagos APC members in launching the South-west Agenda 2023 (SWAGA ‘23), a campaign group championing the candidature of Tinubu for the 2023 presidency.
