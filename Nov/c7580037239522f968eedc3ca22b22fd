A federal high court in Abuja has declared the banishment of Muhammadu Sanusi II, former Emir of Kano, as unlawful and unconstitutional. Anwuli Chikere, while delivering judgment in the suit on Tuesday, held that the action was in gross violation of Sanusi’s fundamental human rights. Consequently, the judge awarded N10 million damages against Kano state, the inspector-general of police (IGP), and the Department of State Services (DSS). Chikere also ordered the Kano state government to tender an apology to the dethroned Emir. The administration of Abdullahi Ganduje had removed Sanusi as Emir on March 9, 2020, over “total disrespect to the office of the governor”. He was subsequently banished and taken to Awe LGA in Nasarawa, where he was confined until he was released on March 13, 2020, following an interim order for his release. The IGP, director-general of the DSS, the attorney-general of Kano, and the attorney-general of the federation are the respondents in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/357/2020. During the adoption of his final brief of argument, Abubakar Mahmoud, Sanusi’s lawyer, had submitted that his client was not disputing his dethronement. According to Mahmoud, his client approached the court over a severe breach of his fundamental rights as a result of the harsh treatment he received after being deposed. The judge, however, struck out the name of the AGF as a respondent in the suit. She also restrained the first, second, and third respondents from harassing the Sanusi.
