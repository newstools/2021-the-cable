President Muhammadu Buhari says there will be peace in the country and Nigerians would no longer grieve the wanton loss of lives. Buhari said this in reaction to the killing of two police officers in Anambra state. The slain officers were travelling with their colleagues when they were ambushed and killed. The federal government has accused the Eastern Security Network (ESN), an outfit of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), of killing the officers. In a statement on Tuesday, Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, quoted the president as condemning “the horrific nature of the bloodletting” in the country. “Noting that the three abducted policemen, two of whom were later brutally executed, were serving the country, and providing security to those who ironically turned against them, President Buhari sends heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, praying for God’s comfort in their deep sorrow,” the spokesman said. “He equally sympathizes with all those who have lost loved ones in the different theatres of insecurity that had rocked the country, charging them to take solace in the inevitable victory of good over evil. “As the areas where insecurity was once fiercest in the country experience some measures of calm now, President Buhari assures that the same would be replicated around the country, and the people would no longer mourn and sorrow from wanton loss of lives.”
