Hakeem Odumosu, commissioner of police in Lagos, says the state is now the safest in the country. He said this on Thursday during the 2021 public lecture of the crime reporters association of Nigeria (CRAN), held at Sheraton Hotel in Ikeja. Odumosu, who assured residents of a crime-free state during the festive season, said the reduction in criminal activities was the result of joint operations involving security agencies. He also commended residents, the media and other security agencies for their cooperation with the police in combating crime. “Traffic robbery was about to increase, but after we clamped down on the hoodlums and arrested the culprits, it was drastically reduced,” NAN quoted him as saying. “He who much is given, much is expected. The police will not relent in making the state safe as patrols will be intensified to check the activities of hoodlums. “Lagos is the safest state in Nigeria now. Everyone comes to Lagos to do business and the police will make sure lives and properties of law-abiding citizens are safe.”
