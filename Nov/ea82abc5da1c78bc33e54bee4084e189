Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), met with United States Vice-President ⁦Kamala Harris⁩ at a dinner hosted by President Macron during the Paris Peace Forum. At the forum, Adesina had called on the developed countries of the world to honour their financial commitments to developing countries as developing nations struggle to battle against climate change and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said COVID had drawn millions, particularly in Africa, into poverty. Highlighting Africa’s financial needs amidst global inequity, Adesina said: “We are only looking for 485 billion dollars in the next three years to emerge from the current crisis. Meanwhile, the developed world has trillions of dollars. “While the developed world is getting second and third Covid-19 booster shots, Africa is struggling to get one basic shot in people’s arms.” He underscored the importance of the International Monetary Fund’s $650 billion of special drawing rights (SDRs), which he said offered developing countries, and African nations in particular, “additional resources as they cope with challenges of building back their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic”.
