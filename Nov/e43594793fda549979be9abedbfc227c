Emirates Airline says it has suspended the resumption of flight operations between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Nigeria to November 30. This is despite the efforts of the federal government to resolve differences with Emirates Airline over COVID-19 guidelines. The airline said this on Wednesday in an updated statement posted on its website. In February, Emirates had suspended flights into Nigeria after the Nigerian government debarred the airline for conducting rapid Covid-19 tests before departure for travellers flying inbound UAE at the Lagos and Abuja airports. The ban was briefly lifted after the airline agreed to discontinue the rapid antigen tests for Nigerian travellers. But Emirates continued to administer the drug, leading to a diplomatic row between the two countries. “Customers who have been to or connected through Nigeria in the last 14 days will not be permitted on any Emirates flights bound for Dubai,” Emirates said. “Affected flight bookings have been cancelled. “If your flight has been cancelled or impacted by route suspensions due to COVID‑19 restrictions, you don’t need to call us immediately for rebooking. “You can simply hold on to your Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with your booking office or us to make new travel plans.”
