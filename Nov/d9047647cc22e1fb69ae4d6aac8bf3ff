Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, says the state has created no fewer than 41, 000 jobs through waste management practices since 2019. Sanwo-Olu said this on Wednesday during the Nordic-Nigeria Connect conference. He said his administration will regulate as well as provide infrastructural and technical support for the private sector to be able to effectively manage the huge amount of waste generated in Lagos. “Following the huge investments we have made in the waste management sector, as well as the transformation of our waste management practices over the last two years, we have been able to create no fewer than 41,000 direct and indirect jobs in that period of time,” he said. “Furthermore, with the advent of recycling and other waste management streams, we envisage there will be about 6,000 additional jobs being created annually. “Daily, in Lagos state, we generate approximately 13,000 metric tonnes of solid waste. It is clear to us that to achieve the levels of efficiency required in managing waste in a city of this size, the private sector must be front-and-centre, while the government focuses on regulation and support by way of infrastructure and technical capacity.” Nina Vaskunlahti, Finland’s deputy minister for international trade, said Finland will support the Lagos state government in its bid to build a smart city by creating jobs through waste management. “Building a smart city involves the use of scientific methods, data and technology to improve the lives of citizens and improve their sustainable development growth. Finland is willing to support this transformation in Lagos,” Vaskunlahti said.
