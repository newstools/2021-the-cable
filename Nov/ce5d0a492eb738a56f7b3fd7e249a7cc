The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says one person sustained injuries following a clash between a vigilante patrol team and herdsmen in Oko-Obbo Ile, Ekiti LGA of Kwara. According to NAN, Babawale Afolabi, the spokesman of the NSCDC, Kwara command, confirmed the development in a statement on Tuesday. “On November 22, some yet-to-be-identified herdsmen, armed with dangerous weapons, ambushed men of the local vigilante, who were on patrol at 2:30 pm,” the statement reads. “The vigilante patrol team was moving along Obbo ile- Isapa axis, when they were attacked by two herdsmen and injured a member of the vigilante team, Mashood Taiye. “The victim was injured with machete cuts, before the herdsmen ran into the bush.” Afolabi said the NSCDC operatives in Ekiti divisional office and the vigilante team tried to track the attackers, but they were unable to apprehend them. He, however, said one suspect, a 23-year-old man from Omu Aran, was arrested and is currently assisting security operatives with information that could help in their investigation. “Efforts are ongoing to capture other herdsmen that are still at large while the victim is responding to treatment at the hospital,” he said.
