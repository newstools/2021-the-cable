Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra, has congratulated Chukwuma Soludo, former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on his victory in the Anambra governorship election. On Wednesday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Soludo, candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), as the winner of the election. The APGA candidate secured 112,229 votes to defeat his two major rivals — Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 53,807 votes, and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who secured 43,285 votes. While congratulating the governor-elect in a statement, Obi thanked the people of Anambra for coming out to vote in the election despite the security challenges in the state. He also appealed to them to support  Soludo. “I congratulate Prof. Chukwuma Soludo on winning the gubernatorial election,” the statement reads. “I thank Anambrarians who braved all odds and came out to perform their civic duties. I  urge them to support the in-coming Governor through prayers and other legitimate means to see that Anambra returns to her former glory as the ‘Light of the Nation’. “Most importantly, I shall continue to commit the state into God’s hands for His will to be done at all times.” President Muhammadu Buhari had also congratulated Soludo, also asking him to mobilise other stakeholders to address the “enormous challenges” facing Anambra and the region.
