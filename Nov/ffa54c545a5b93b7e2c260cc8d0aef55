Gunmen on Thursday abducted at least four persons along Auga-Ise road in Akoko East LGA of Ondo state. The abductees include a principal and teachers from the same school. Confirming the incident to TheCable, Funmi Odunlami, the state police spokesperson, said four persons were abducted. “The incident happened yesterday afternoon when they were on their way home from the school in a vehicle. They had already left the community where the school was and got to a road that was bad. It was there that they were attacked and kidnapped,” she said. “Our officers are currently in the area trying to see how the victims can be rescued and also to apprehend the perpetrators.” In the past few months, there have been several highway killings and abductions in different parts of the country. In September, gunmen attacked an 18-passenger commercial bus in Ondo state. The Lagos-bound bus was attacked along Ido Ani-Ifira-Akoko Expressway and all passengers were abducted. Recently, in October, two children were abducted in Akure. The attackers stole a car belonging to the victims’ mother and drove away with the kids.
