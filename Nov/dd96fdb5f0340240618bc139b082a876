Sources said the gunmen had earlier attacked the soldiers, and killed one of them in Awo-Omamma in Oru east LGA of the state. The soldiers were alleged to have stormed the popular Awo-Omamma junction in search of the gunmen and in the process, set houses, shops, a fuel station, and a hotel ablaze. Other valuables worth millions of naira were also said to have been destroyed in the fire. In a video now making the rounds, an eyewitness says “everywhere is burning; Awo junction has finished; these people made sure they burnt everywhere before they left; since morning nobody came outside”.
