Onyebuchi Offor, lawmaker representing Ekwusigo constituency at the Anambra house of assembly, has rejoined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Offor had defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in September. “It is time I join the party at the centre so that my constituents can feel and experience the presence of the ruling party,” he had said. The lawmaker, however, announced his return to the PDP at plenary in Awka on Thursday. He said his decision followed consultation with constituents and stakeholders from his area. “Two months ago, I announced my defection from PDP to APC on the floor of this house. I have tested the waters and realised that my former party PDP is better,” NAN quoted him as saying. “So, I want to humbly inform this house that I’m going back to my party, the PDP.” Noble Igwe, lawmaker representing Ogbaru I constituency, welcomed Offor back to the party and said “PDP would have won the just concluded governorship election in the state if Offor had not defected to APC”. “Your defection to APC was a big blow to the PDP in Anambra, but we welcome you back to PDP where you rightly belong,” he added. Uche Okafor, speaker of the house, said it was the constitutional right of the lawmaker to defect from one political party to another, and wished Offor well in his political career. On September 21, four lawmakers elected on the platform of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the state assembly also defected to the APC.
