The Lagos government has announced a traffic diversion as a result of repairs on the stadium flyover in the Surulere area of the state. The flyover will not be operational between November 19 and December 24. In a statement over the weekend, Frederic Oladeinde, Lagos commissioner for transportation, said repairs at the flyover would be in phases. Oladeinde said diversion points for phase one of the rehabilitation would be from Alaka to the stadium service lane inbound the barracks in Surulere. “The state traffic management authority will be on ground to coordinate movement,” he said. The commissioner appealed to the citizenry for their “understanding and patience amidst various ongoing road projects within the State”. He added that “the end result will be beneficial to the people and Lagos”.
