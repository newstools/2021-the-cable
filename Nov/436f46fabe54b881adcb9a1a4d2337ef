Napoli FC have confirmed the injury lay-off of Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles striker, for three months. The Italian club announced Osimhen’s facial injury in a statement on its official website on Tuesday. Osimhen, who is Napoli’s top scorer this season with nine goals in 14 appearances, suffered multiple facial fractures after a nasty clash of heads with Inter Milan’s Skriniar in their Serie A encounter over the weekend. The 22-year-old was forced off in the 52nd minute with a side of his face swollen from the impact. The match finished 3-2 with Napoli suffering their first defeat of the season. The club also said that the striker had undergone successful surgery on the face with “titanium plates and screws.” It added that Osimhen will be out of action for about 90 days. “On Tuesday morning, Victor Osimhen was operated on his cheekbone and eye socket by Gianpaolo Tartaro, who was assisted by Dr Mario Santagata with Dr Raffaele Canonico also present,” the statement read. “Titanium plates and screws were used in the operation. The player is doing well and will remain under observation for the next few days. Osimhen is expected to return to action in three months.” The development means Osimhen might not recover on time for the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) billed for Cameroon — between January 9 and February 6, 2022. The lanky striker joins Oghenekaro Etebo on the Super Eagles’ injury list as preparation for the competition takes a more awry turn for Nigeria.
