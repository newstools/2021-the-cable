Salihu Mustapha, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship aspirant, says he will work to ensure a party that promotes equity. He also said if elected the chairman of the party, he would work towards reconciling factions. The development comes days after Atiku Bagudu, chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), said President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed February 2022 for the APC national convention. The convention serves as the platform through which the chairman of the party will be elected. Speaking with journalists on Friday, Mustapha, who was once a deputy national chairman of the Congress for Progressives Change (CPC), said he has what it takes to move the party to a new level. “I have been endorsed by every well-meaning stakeholder; that is why I am motivated in this race,” he said. “As a former deputy national chairman of CPC, I led CPC to the merger. So, nobody is older than me in Kwara APC. They all met me in the party. “I have retained that neutrality and I’m hoping that given the opportunity to be chairman of the party will be my first legal step on reconciling the factions in the party. We need all hands on deck. “Being a key player in how the merger came about, I decided to step into the arena for the post of APC national chairman because I believe we don’t have the best. “I have gathered enough experience and enough goodwill. I want to see a party where there is fairness, equity and justice, not a party where there is imposition.” Mustapha also said he is not intimated by positions held by other aspirants, adding that ideology should be the dominant factor in choosing a chairman for the APC. “I’m not intimidated by titles; I bow to superior argument. It is ideas that rule. I will be looking forward to working with all these fellow aspirants who I believe are major stakeholders,” he said. “Our challenges are not what can tear the party apart. We have been able to manage our challenges and that is why people are begging to join us.”
