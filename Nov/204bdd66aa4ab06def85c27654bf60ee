Speaking after the tournament, Sunil Thadani, chairman of the Indian Golf Foundation, said the annual event was successful with an impressive player turnout. “We got from different corporates that include Pepsi, African Industries, Qatar Airways and Zenith Bank who believe in the Indo-Nigeria business relationship,” Thadani said. As businesses continue to recover from the setback of Covid-19, we believe India Cup was the perfect event for our sponsors.” Over 400 players participated at different levels, leading to the final where Eben-Spiff shot 77, six over par to pick the best gross prize. In the net category, Martins returned 67 to lead the pack, leaving Yomi Sanni with the runner-up prize and C. Ekeocha at third place.
