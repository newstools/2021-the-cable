Ameer Sarkee, a Kano-based textile trader, has indicated interest to contest for the position of the national women leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In an interview with BBC Pidgin, 26-year-old Sarkee said he is contesting for the position because he believes a man should “take charge of the affairs of women at all times”. According to the newspaper, Ameer had once contested for the position on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019 but lost. He, however, said he would not give up, as women affairs have been a priority to him since he was a child. “Even when I was small, anytime I see a woman that needs help, I try to assist her, maybe to carry load or go buy something for her. These are some of the things that guide me and make me feel I deserve the women leader position,” he was quoted as saying. “Some people are asking me why a man will contest for women leader position and the answer I give them is that God destined men to guide the affairs of women. So, it is not a bad thing for me to want to lead women especially when I mean well for them.” Ameer added that if he wins, he would ensure that women get more representation at all levels of government. On challenges, Ameer said he wishes that women that are members of the ruling party would accept him and allow him to lead them. “The biggest challenge is to win the acceptance of women. Some are jealous of me and others feel like I want to seize what belongs to them but that is not true,” he said. “At the same time, I get a lot of encouragement and support. Even yesterday, some women groups met with me on my ambition. Also, on social media, many send me supportive messages.”
