The African Action Congress (AAC) says those who gave the order to shoot protesters at the Lekki tollgate should be punished. The AAC said this following the findings of a panel set up to investigate the shooting of protesters at the Lekki tollgate in Lagos during the demonstrations against police brutality in 2020. On Monday, a report of the Lagos state judicial panel on police brutality said protesters were killed at the tollgate in what the panel described as a “massacre”. In a statement on Tuesday, Femi Adeyeye, AAC national publicity secretary, said it is unfortunate that “enormous” resources were deployed to deny the shooting. “The Justice Okuwobi-panel agreed with us that the military under the direct command of President Buhari were at the Lekki toll gate with police officers from different units, including the ‘disbanded’ SARS and they both attempted a cover-up by taking away bodies, destroying evidence and not appearing before the panel as they should,” Adeyeye said. “What is more unfortunate than the killing is the enormous resources deployed by the state to deny the killing – a gross insult on the intelligence of Nigerians. “However good it is to memorialize the day and place where people lost their lives, just for being citizens, we can not continue this way as a people. It has become second nature of the state to kill and remember or ‘pardon’ innocent people later. “We just had an anniversary remembrance of the killing of Ken Saro Wiwa and the Ogoni8. Nigeria has got too many martyrs.”
