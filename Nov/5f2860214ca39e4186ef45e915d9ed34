Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, has announced new measures following the discovery of the new variant of coronavirus. The UK has recorded two cases of Omicron — the new highly infectious COVID-19 variant. According to the prime minister, all travellers to the UK will have to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by the end of second day of their arrival. He said travellers must self-isolate until they receive a negative test result. “All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace,” the new rule stated. “Face coverings will become compulsory on public transport and in shops – not including hospitality. “The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) will consider giving boosters to a wider age group, as well as reducing the gap between the second dose and booster.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) described Omicron as a “variant of concern”, calling on global leaders to take action to contain its spread.
