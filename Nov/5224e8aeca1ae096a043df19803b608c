The Yellow Green, Nigerian senior men’s cricket team, will this week begin a four-day six-match session for the ticket to represent Africa at the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. Speaking on Sunday, Uyi Akpata, president of Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), said the team’s preparation for the World Cup is going well. He added that he expects fair competition in the group that comprises of Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya as the Yellow Green take to the oval on Wednesday. “We have had the team training together for weeks and had two major tournament exposures in Uganda and the bilateral series with Sierra Leone in Lagos,” Akpata said. Nigeria was the first team to arrive for the event, a decision which Asanka Gurusinha, the coach, said would enable the team settle in well ahead of the busy qualifying schedule. “This qualifiers’ schedule is a tough one and I think our team is very ready for the on-field battle. At each of the stage of our preparation we have brought in new learnings that have improved the quality of the team. I think we have a far better team now and I am optimistic of a good outing,” said Gurusinha, who was hired late last year. Nigeria will play Tanzania and Uganda in the opening games at the Gahanga International Cricket Stadium in Kigali, Rwanda on Wednesday. The team will resume with another double header on Thursday against Kenya and Uganda at the IPRC cricket ground. All teams would go on break on Friday before hostilities resume for the final round on Saturday when Kenya and Tanzania are again lined up at the IPRC grounds in Kigali. Gurusinha has also confirmed that Slyvester Okpe, former U-19 player, would be making his debut as team captain, replacing Joshua Ayannaike at the T20 qualifiers. He also expressed hope that the young Okpe would come good. “I have taken Sylvester on several times as we talked plans and strategies. I believe in his ability and I look forward to great things from him in Kigali,” the coach said.
